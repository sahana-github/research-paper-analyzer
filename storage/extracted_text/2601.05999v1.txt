Multi-messenger observations of neutron stars (NSs) and their mergers have placed strong con-
straints on the dense-matter equation of state (EOS). The EOS, in turn, depends on microscopic
nuclear interactions that are described by nuclear Hamiltonians. These Hamiltonians are commonly
derived within chiral effective field theory (EFT). Ideally, multi-messenger observations of NSs could
be used to directly inform our understanding of EFT interactions, but such a direct inference neces-
sitates millions of model evaluations. This is computationally prohibitive because each evaluation
requires us to calculate the EOS from a Hamiltonian by solving the quantum many-body problem
with methods such as auxiliary-field diffusion Monte Carlo (AFDMC), which provides very accu-
rate and precise solutions but at a significant computational cost. Additionally, we need to solve
the stellar structure equations for each EOS which further slows down each model evaluation by
a few seconds. In this work, we combine emulators for AFDMC calculations of neutron matter,
built using parametric matrix models, and for the stellar structure equations, built using multilayer
perceptron neural networks, with the PyCBC data-analysis framework to enable a direct inference
of coupling constants in an EFT Hamiltonian using multi-messenger observations of NSs. We find
that astrophysical data can provide informative constraints on two-nucleon couplings despite the
high densities probed in NS interiors.
Introduction. Neutron-star (NS) cores explore densi-
ties far larger than those in the center of atomic nuclei,
providing unique opportunities to test theories of strong
interactions [1–3]. The properties of NSs, such as their
radii, masses, and tidal deformabilities, depend on micro-
scopic interactions between nucleons at densities up to a
few times the nuclear saturation density n0 ≃0.16 fm−3
and, possibly, between exotic degrees of freedom at higher
densities. Multi-messenger observations of NS properties
can, therefore, directly inform our understanding of these
interactions.
Modern nuclear interactions are described by Hamilto-
nians derived within chiral effective field theory (EFT),
which provides a systematic expansion of nuclear forces
in powers of the average nucleon momenta p over a break-
down scale Λb [4, 5]. Chiral EFT Hamiltonians depend
on a set of low-energy couplings (LECs) which deter-
mine the strength of individual operator structures that
appear at different orders in this expansion. In the two-
nucleon (NN) sector, these LECs are typically adjusted to
NN scattering data by solving the quantum-mechanical
scattering problem [6–12]. In the three-nucleon (3N) sec-
tor, the LECs are usually fit to ground-state properties
of light nuclei or the triton β decay [13–20], but differ-
ent fit protocols have been proposed [21, 22]. The chiral
EFT Hamiltonians are then employed in predictive cal-
culations of larger quantum many-body systems, such as
∗armst520@msu.edu
medium-mass to heavy atomic nuclei [22–31] or dense
nuclear matter [16, 19, 32–38].
Terrestrial nuclear systems, however, only explore
small neutron-to-proton asymmetries and densities of the
order of n0. Matter in NSs, in contrast, is very isospin-
asymmetric and probes much larger densities. Adjusting
nuclear forces and their LECs to properties of NS matter
would provide valuable complementary constraints [39–
42]. In this work, we explore how well data from NS mass
measurements [43–45] from a gravitational-wave (GW)
observation of two merging NSs, GW170817 [46], and
from the Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer
(NICER) telescope [47–50] enable us to constrain the rel-
evant LECs in a nuclear Hamiltonian from chiral EFT at
next-to-next-to-leading order (N2LO) in neutron matter.
Approach. To extract LECs from NS observations, our
goal is to employ Bayesian inference to analyze astro-
physical data. Bayesian inference necessitates millions of
model evaluations, and hence, it requires us to be able
to rapidly connect LECs with NS observables. To date,
this connection is too computationally expensive. First,
it requires solving the quantum many-body problem to
obtain the dense-matter EOS from a given set of LECs,
a process which costs 100,000’s of CPU hours per EOS.
Second, NS observables are calculated from an EOS by
solving the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equa-
tions, which takes a few seconds per EOS. These two
steps are prohibitively slow for Bayesian inference; typi-
cally, likelihood evaluations need to be performed in less
than ∼1s [51]. Therefore, reducing this computational

burden is essential.
Recent works have taken first steps in this direction.
Refs. [39, 40] obtained constraints on a simplified Hamil-
tonian with a single free parameter representing the
strength of a phenomenological 3N force from NS ob-
servations.
However, a connection to 3N forces from
EFT and the possible existence of non-nucleonic degrees
of freedom at high densities were not addressed in that
work. This was overcome in Ref. [42] where the two pion-
nucleon LECs that determine the strength of chiral 3N
forces in neutron matter at N2LO were studied using a
more flexible EOS model. In both works, broad uniform
prior distributions on the 3N LECs were employed and
canonical constraints from nuclear experiments, such as
NN scattering data analyzed consistently with EFT trun-
cation uncertainties, were not taken into account.
Here, we overcome these limitations and study the im-
pact of NS observations on all unknown LECs in an N2LO
Hamiltonian in neutron matter, rather than limiting our-
selves to the 3N sector. We achieve this by combining
our previously developed emulators [52] for auxiliary-field
diffusion Monte Carlo (AFDMC) [53, 54] calculations of
neutron matter and for the TOV equations [51] to es-
tablish a direct connection of the LECs at N2LO with
NS properties. As the long-range pion-nucleon LECs are
very tightly constrained from experimental data [55, 56],
we keep them fixed in this work. Then, the 3N sector
in neutron matter is parameter-free at this order [32],
and we effectively study the contact sector of the NN
force. This allows us to analyze the interplay between
NN scattering data and NS observations in constraining
the Hamiltonian.
We employ both of our emulators to sample over the
LECs when analyzing NS data and performing GW infer-
ence with PyCBC [57]. Prior information from NN scatter-
ing data is incorporated in a hierarchical manner within
PyCBC by implementing LEC posteriors from a scattering
analysis [12] as GW priors. We present our main results
in Fig. 1, and find that present astrophysical data pro-
vide slight constraints on the relevant spectral LECs at
N2LO if nuclear Hamiltonians are used up to 2n0. We
also study the potential of next-generation GW detec-
tors and find that these observatories can provide strong
constraints on LECs, highlighting their high discovery
potential for nuclear physics.
Emulators for Dense Matter.
For a given Hamilto-
nian with a specified set of LECs, we employ AFDMC to
calculate the EOS of pure neutron matter. AFDMC pro-
vides very accurate and precise solutions to the quantum
many-body problem but at a significant computational
cost. We have employed the parametric matrix model
(PMM) [58] to build emulators for AFDMC calculations

of pure neutron matter for local chiral EFT Hamiltonians
at N2LO [52]. The PMM is based off of the reduced-basis
method (RBM) [59–65] which identifies a relevant low-
dimensional subspace that contains the solution space as
the LECs in the Hamiltonian are varied. While the RBM
explicitly calculates this subspace from high-fidelity so-
lutions to the problem at hand, the PMM identifies this
subspace implicitly through fitting matrix elements in a
representative low-dimensional matrix equation directly
to the AFDMC data. This equation is set up as an eigen-
value problem for a matrix ˆH with the same structure as
the chiral EFT Hamiltonian:
ˆH = H0 + d1 · H1 + d2 · H2 + · · · ,

with real matrix elements a −h. These matrix elements
are constrained by fitting the lowest eigenvalue of ˆH to
AFDMC energies in neutron matter for ∼30 training
LEC sets. At N2LO, there are nine operator LECs de-
scribing NN forces, but only six combinations of these op-
erator LECs, i.e. spectral LECs, contribute to pure neu-
tron matter. The emulator is set up with the six relevant
spectral LECs di. The 3N forces are fixed because, in
neutron matter, they only depend on pion-nucleon LECs
at N2LO.
The emulators developed in Ref. [52] allow us to speed
up AFDMC calculations by a factor of 108 while main-
taining errors around 1%, which is comparable to the
statistical uncertainty of AFDMC [53].
This dramatic
reduction of computational cost enables us to perform
Bayesian inference. More details on our PMM emulator
can be found in Ref. [52].
Neutron-Star Equations of State. For a given set of
LECs, the PMM allows us to calculate the neutron-
matter energy per particle at 0.12, 0.16, 0.24, 0.32,
0.48 fm−3. We then use the nuclear meta-model [66, 67]
to extend the PMM output to neutron-star matter. The
metamodel describes the energy per particle of nuclear
matter at various densities and asymmetries in terms
of the nuclear empirical parameters (NEPs), defined by
Taylor expansions of the energy per particle in symmetric
nuclear matter and of the symmetry energy.
We first generate a set of symmetric-matter parame-
ters.
We fix Esat = −16 MeV and nsat = 0.16 fm−3,
and sample Ksat, Qsat, and Zsat from the following
Gaussian distributions: Ksat = 227 ± 18 MeV, Qsat =
−172 ± 243 MeV, and Zsat = 1287 ± 1499 MeV [68].
We then sample a set of six spectral LECs d11, d22, d3,
d4, d6, and d7 from the posteriors of Ref. [12], and use
the PMM to generate a neutron-matter EOS. With both
curves specified, we fit the meta-model, and generate an
EOS in beta equilibrium. For all models, we attach the
crust of Douchin and Haensel [69] below 0.08 fm−3 fol-
lowing the approach outlined in Ref. [70]. Therefore, each
meta-model EOS depends on a set of 9 parameters.
Because we cannot expect the nucleonic description of
dense matter to be valid at the highest densities reached
in the cores of NSs, we transition from the meta-model
to a speed-of-sound extension [71–73] at a transition den-
sity ntr = 2n0. We sample values of the squared speed
of sound, c2
i , uniformly between 10−5 and 1 on a den-
sity grid ranging from 3n0 to 6n0 in steps of n0.
We
then connect these points by linear speed-of-sound seg-
ments and choose the speed of sound to be constant after
the last density point. Finally, we connect the speed-of-
sound model to the meta model and construct the EOS
at all densities up to 12n0. Each final EOS is, therefore,
described by a total of 13 parameters.
Emulators for neutron-star structure. To build emu-
lators for the TOV equations, we follow Ref. [51] and
employ multilayer-perceptron (MLP) neural networks.
We generate mass–radius and mass–tidal-deformability
curves for 270,000 EOS, and split these into a train-
ing set (200,000 EOS) and a validation set (70,000
EOS). We remove all samples with a maximum NS mass
MTOV < 2M⊙because the observations of heavy pulsars
with masses greater than 2M⊙rule these EOS out. We
then build three separate MLP networks to respectively
emulate MTOV, the radii r(m), and the tidal deformabil-
ities Λ(m). Each MLP emulator takes the 13 parameters
describing each EOS as input.
To emulate MTOV, we train an MLP regressor to the
MTOV of our training EOS. For the validation set, our
emulator predicts MTOV with errors of ∼0.01%, see
Fig. 2. To build emulators for the radii and tidal deforma-
bilities, we define a mass grid of 30 uniformly spaced
4
points between 1M⊙and MTOV for each of the train-
ing EOS. Two MLP regressors are then trained on the
radii and the logarithm of the tidal deformabilities at
the grid points, respectively. For any new parameter set,
we first predict MTOV and then use the other emulators
to infer radii and tidal deformabilities at the mass-grid
points. We find that these emulators perform extremely
well, with speed ups of two orders of magnitude [51] and
errors around 0.01% over the validation set, see Fig. 2 for
the error distributions for both quantities at 1.4M⊙. We
show example outputs in the Supplemental Material.
Multimessenger Data Analysis. Recent years have seen
a wealth of new NS data. Radio observations of heavy
pulsars have firmly established the existence of two-solar-
mass NSs [43–45].
The first gravitational-wave (GW)
observation of a binary NS merger, GW170817 [46], con-
strained the tidal deformability for a 1.4M⊙NS to be
190+390
−120 at the 90% credible level [74], implying the EOS
to be rather soft up to (3 −4)n0. Finally, NICER has
measured the masses and radii of four pulsars [47–50].
To analyze GW170817 data, we follow Ref. [57] to im-
plement the MLP networks in the PyCBC GW Bayesian
analysis software. We compute the posterior p(⃗θ|d(t), H)
by sampling over the parameters ⃗θ that enter the
waveform model H, for which we choose the SEOB-
NRv4T surrogate template [75]. The parameters ⃗θ are
the 13 parameters that describe the EOS as well as
the parameters describing the binary system.
For the
EOS parameters, we use our emulators to predict r(m)
and Λ(m) between 1.0M⊙and MTOV. As in Ref. [57],
we fix the sky and distance parameters to the ones for
GW170817 [76, 77] and sample the source frame chirp
mass Msrc
c , mass ratio q, offset of trigger time ∆tc, incli-
nation angle ι, and the two NS spins χ1z,2z, and marginal-
ize the polarization angle and phase using a uniform prior
from [0, 2π) for both. We compare the predicted wave-
form to the strain data d(t) measured by the LIGO Han-
ford, LIGO Livingston, and Virgo detectors [78, 79], by
employing PyCBC Inference [80] and sample using the em-
cee Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampler. The
inference calls the emulator via a plug-in waveform model
developed in Ref. [57].
In Fig. 3, we show 9800 mass-radius relations drawn
from the GW posterior of our PyCBC analysis. The main
effect of the GW data is to rule out stiffer EOS, consis-
tent with previous analyses [42, 46, 81–87]. We further
apply the maximum-mass constraint by comparing the
predicted Mmax for each EOS to the observed neutron
star masses [70]. The likelihood is dominated by PSR
J0740+6620 [45] with a mass of 2.08 ± 0.07 M⊙. Finally,
we apply mass-radius constraints from the four NICER
pulsars PSR J0030+0451 [47], PSR J0740+6620 [48],
PSR J0437–4715 [49], and PSR J0614-3329 [50].
For
the first two pulsars, independent results have been pro-
vided by the Maryland group of the NICER collabora-
tion [85, 88]. Given all sources of data, we can put tight
constraints on the NS mass-radius relation. We find the
radius of a 1.4M⊙NS to be 11.6+0.7
−0.5km at the 90% cred-

ible level.
Constraining Nuclear Interactions. Because we sam-
ple over the EOS parameters during the data analysis,
we can directly infer the LECs from multi-messenger ob-
servations of NSs and their mergers.
We present our
results for the LECs given present astrophysical obser-
vations in Fig. 1 and find that current NS data pro-
vides modest information on some spectral LECs. While
the distributions of the LECs that enter PNM through
their contribution to singlet S-wave interactions (d22 and
d3) [89] remain nearly unchanged, the distributions of the
LECs entering the triplet P-wave channels (d11, d4, d6,
and d7) undergo moderate change after the inference is
performed. The astrophysical data reduces P-wave re-
pulsion, which is in line with NS data preferring softer
EOS. This is driven by both GW and NICER data which
pull the LEC posteriors in the same direction, see the
Supplemental Material. As a consequence, even present
NS observations provide information on NN forces in the
nuclear Hamiltonian, beyond what is provided by scat-
tering data.
Impact of Future Detectors. Future observations, for
example by next-generation GW detectors such as Cos-
mic Explorer [90, 91] or the Einstein Telescope [92, 93],
will provide additional precision data that allows us to
further constrain the LECs.
To demonstrate this, we
inject two simulated events into a detector network com-
posed of two Cosmic Explorer interferometers and one
Einstein Telescope. For both events, we chose most of
the injection parameter values consistent with those that
were inferred for GW170817. For the first event, the two
component masses were taken to be 1.4 M⊙, leading to

an SNR of ∼2300. For the second event, the two com-
ponent masses were decreased to 1.0 M⊙to probe the
sensitivity of the LECs to the NS masses.
This event
was found to have an SNR of ∼1730. The injected LEC
values were chosen to be close to the 50th percentiles of
the corresponding prior distributions. The obtained pos-
teriors for the LECs are also shown in Fig. 1. We find
that next-generation GW detectors can provide signifi-
cant constraints on the LECs for these two events. Inter-
estingly, the LECs are better constrained for the lower
SNR (low-mass) event as it probes lower densities that
are closer to the regime described by chiral EFT.
Finally, for these next-generation posteriors, we re-
examine the phase shifts in the triplet P-wave channels.
We find no changes to the phase shift in the 3P0 partial
wave and marginal changes in the 3P2 channel with re-
spect to the priors. However, we observe a clear change in
the 3P1 channel mainly at high energies ≳200 MeV, see
Fig. 4. This channel is repulsive and leads to the largest
of the P-wave phase shifts whereas 3P0 and 3P2 are both
attractive and smaller in magnitude. As we found before,
the data seems to overall reduce P-wave repulsion. This
analysis serves as an important sensitivity study which
demonstrates that, among the triplet P waves, the 3P1
channel is more strongly correlated with the properties of
NSs. In addition, the fact that the spectral LECs change
considerably after next-generation data is included while
the phase shift bands change only moderately shows that
astrophysical data provides complementary information
when compared to NN scattering.
Summary and Outlook. In this work, we have used em-
ulators based on the PMM and MLP machine-learning
frameworks to constrain the relevant two-nucleon LECs
in an N2LO chiral EFT Hamiltonian from NS data. We
found that current observations only provide mild con-
straints in addition to two-nucleon scattering measured
in the lab, but that next-generation GW observatories
provide strong and complimentary information on micro-
scopic LECs. Our pipeline paves the way of measuring
LECs that are difficult to extract from laboratory data.

SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIAL
A.
Emulators for TOV
In Fig. 5, we show a set of example mass–radius and mass–tidal-deformability curves from the validation set. We
find excellent agreement between the original high-fidelity EOS and the emulator output.
FIG. 5. Examples of solutions to the TOV equations using the high-fidelity solver (lines) and the emulator predictions (points).
Left: Mass–radius relations. Right: Mass–tidal-deformability curves.
B.
LEC inference at every stage of the analysis
In Fig. 6, we show the results of the LEC inference using current astrophysical data at each step in the analysis, so
GW data only, GW and maximum mass data, and finally the full result shown in Fig. 1 of the main manuscript.
FIG. 6. Priors (red) and posteriors at different stages in the analysis of astrophysical data for all six spectral LECs in neutron
matter. The priors are results of fits to NN scattering data. The posteriors include only GW data (green), GW and maximum-
mass data (blue), and GW, maximum-mass, and NICER data (blue).
