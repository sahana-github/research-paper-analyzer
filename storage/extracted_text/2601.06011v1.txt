ABSTRACT
The study of galaxy groups is essential to understanding the evolutionary history of large-scale structures in the Universe.
These dense environments have a significant impact on galaxy evolution, influencing their gas content, morphology, and star
formation activity. In this work we analyse in detail the system NGC 5098/5096 composed of two galaxy groups. We performed
hydrodynamical 𝑁-body simulations of a galaxy group collision aimed at reproducing the gas sloshing and surface brightness
distribution observed in X-ray data. We conducted a detailed X-ray analysis and generated mock image Chandra observations
from our simulations. The resulting corrected mock image surface brightness profiles show good agreement with the observed
data. The relative line-of-sight velocity between NGC 5098 and NGC 5096 is 𝑣los = 700 km s−1, with a projected separation
of 𝑑proj = 155 kpc, suggesting that the collision occurs nearly in the line-of-sight. Our simulations were performed with an
inclination angle of 80◦in order to reproduce the dynamical constraints. We also find a correlation between the dark matter
and intragroup light distributions when comparing the residual dark matter map with the intragroup light morphology. Our
best-fitting model is consistent with these observational constraints and provides a plausible dynamical scenario for the current
state of the NGC 5098 group interaction with NGC 5096.

1 INTRODUCTION
Galaxy groups are gravitationally bound systems that contain more
than half of all galaxies in the low redshift Universe (e.g. Eke et al.
2004; Robotham et al. 2011). These systems arise naturally in a
Universe where structure forms hierarchically, with the merging
of smaller groups leading to increasingly massive halos, ultimately
forming rich galaxy clusters (e.g. Press & Schechter 1974; Fakhouri
& Ma 2010). Galaxy groups occupy an intermediate mass regime
between massive elliptical galaxies (∼1012 M⊙) and galaxy clusters
(∼1014 M⊙), and they host a substantial fraction of the baryonic
matter in the local Universe (e.g. Fukugita et al. 1998; Eke et al.
2004).
In terms of their optical and physical properties, galaxy groups
have been broadly classified into different categories: poor (or loose),
compact, rich, and fossil groups (e.g. Lovisari et al. 2021). Dynami-
cally, compact groups, being relatively isolated by definition (Hick-
son 1982), tend to exhibit more relaxed configurations. Conversely,
many galaxy groups are dynamically unrelaxed, undergoing mergers
and interactions with infalling substructures (e.g. Tempel et al. 2017;
O’Sullivan et al. 2019).
In the X-ray band, many groups show extended diffuse emission of

the intragroup medium (hereafter IGM), with features such as surface
brightness discontinuities, cold fronts, and sloshing (e.g. Markevitch
& Vikhlinin 2007; Laganá et al. 2010; Gastaldello et al. 2013).
The Chandra and XMM-Newton X-ray observatories have enabled
detailed investigations of collision and merger dynamics in galaxy
groups and clusters. By combining these observations with 𝑁-body
hydrodynamical simulations we have better understood the origin
of shock fronts (e.g. Springel & Farrar 2007; Donnert 2014; Moura
et al. 2021; Albuquerque et al. 2024; Chadayammuri et al. 2024;
Machado et al. 2024) and cold fronts (e.g. Markevitch & Vikhlinin
2007; Roediger & Zuhone 2012; Gastaldello et al. 2013; Doubrawa
et al. 2020; Machado et al. 2022) in the intragroup and intracluster
medium.
Galaxy groups and clusters often host active galactic nuclei (here-
after AGN) with jets of relativistic plasma that emit synchrotron ra-
diation (e.g. Tadhunter 2016). The mechanical feedback from AGN
is an important mechanism for heating the gas in cool-core regions.
Evidence of this mechanical feedback is found in the X-ray cavities
observed in galaxy groups and clusters, on scales roughly coinci-
dent with the lobes of the central radio galaxy (e.g. McNamara et al.
2000). The radio plasma emitted by the AGN displaces the gas, gen-
erating low-density bubbles that distribute energy to the surrounding
medium. Such cavities or bubbles, identified by depressions in sur-
face brightness, can extend to distances of up to 186 kpc, as observed

in the extreme case of the galaxy cluster MS 0735.6+7421 (Biava
et al. 2021).
Galaxy groups have shallower potential wells and thus lower mean
temperatures than clusters. Therefore non-gravitational processes
such as galactic winds, radiative cooling, and AGN feedback, play a
more significant role in their evolution. In this environment, even a
single massive galaxy falling into a group-scale halo with a nonzero
impact parameter can perturb the IGM, inducing gas motions, trans-
ferring angular momentum, and producing a spiral pattern in the
IGM that also manifests as sloshing features.
X-ray analyses of interacting galaxy groups (e.g. Xue et al. 2004;
Kraft et al. 2006; Randall et al. 2009; Machacek et al. 2010;
Gastaldello et al. 2013; O’Sullivan et al. 2014; Schellenberger et al.
2023; Lima Neto et al. 2025) are relatively less common than in-
teracting clusters due to their intrinsically lower luminosities. Since
galaxy groups outnumber clusters (Tully 1987; Eke et al. 2004),
understanding the range of collision and merger-driven effects on
their gas and galaxy properties is essential for constructing accurate
models of hierarchical structure formation.
NGC 5098 is a galaxy group dominated by a central pair of ellipti-
cal galaxies, NGC 5098a and NGC 5098b, identified by Ramella
et al. (1995). Based on the SDSS1 data, the brightest galaxy is
NGC 5098a, with absolute magnitudes of 𝑀𝐵= −21.131 and
𝑀𝑉= −22.097, as computed by Randall et al. (2009), and redshift
𝑧= 0.03606 ± 0.00001 (Lee et al. 2017). NGC 5098b has absolute
magnitudes of 𝑀𝐵= −20.845 and 𝑀𝑉= −21.770, with redshift
𝑧= 0.03744 ± 0.00008 (Miller et al. 2002). Their line-of-sight rel-
ative velocity is 𝑣los = 413 km s−1, and their projected separation is
𝑑proj = 27 kpc. Note that the western galaxy, NGC 5098a, hosts the
extended radio source B2 1317+33, which has been detected at 1415,
4850, and 4996 MHz (Fanti et al. 1977; Becker et al. 1991).
At a projected distance of 155 kpc southwest of NGC 5098 lies
the galaxy group NGC 5096 originally considered part of NGC 5098
(e.g. Ramella et al. 1995) but already recognized as an independent
sub-system by Mahdavi et al. (2005).
As discussed by Lima Neto et al. (2025) (hereafter Paper I), the
overall structure of NGC 5098 comprises two subsystems: i) a dom-
inant group with mean redshift 𝑧= 0.03605 centred on NGC 5098a
and having virial mass of 𝑀200 = (3.93 ± 0.28) × 1013 M⊙and ra-
dius 𝑅200 = (0.69 ± 0.02) Mpc. This group comprises 82 galaxies
to 𝑟< 18 mag; ii) a smaller group with mean redshift 𝑧= 0.03886
distributed around the compact group NGC 5096 (Zandivarez et al.
(2022)) with virial mass 𝑀200 = (0.17 ± 0.02) × 1013 M⊙and ra-
dius 𝑅200 = (0.24 ± 0.01) Mpc (Paper I). This implies a mass ratio
of approximately 1:20 for the NGC 5098/5096 system. This group
has about 30 members (𝑟< 18 mag) from which five belong to the
compact group itself.
NGC 5098 was detected as an extended X-ray source in the ROSAT
All-Sky Survey (RASS, Mahdavi et al. 2000). Subsequent studies of
its global structure have been carried out with XMM-Newton (Xue
et al. 2004) and, with higher spatial resolution, with Chandra (Sun
et al. 2009), while Randall et al. (2009) used deep Chandra data
obtained with the more sensitive detector ACIS-S3. They identified
a spiral-like arm that can be interpreted as a sloshing pattern origi-
nating at NGC 5098a and winding outward in a clockwise direction
from northeast to west. They also reported X-ray cavities coincident
with VLA 1.45 GHz radio emission, indicating recent AGN-driven
outbursts.
Analysis of the deep Chandra imaging by Randall et al. (2009)
1 https://skyserver.sdss.org/dr18
shows that there are 14 cavities detected within a radius of 22 kpc
centred on the AGN, with an average cavity volume of 31 kpc3. Two
of these cavities, located to the north and southeast of the central
AGN, are spatially correlated with radio emission and, based on
pressure estimates and their proximity to the AGN, are likely re-
cent features. The other X-ray cavities, which show no correlation
with radio emission, appear to be ghost cavities from previous AGN
outbursts (Randall et al. 2009).
In galaxy groups and clusters there is a low surface brightness
stellar component, typically found in the surroundings of the brightest
cluster galaxies and massive satellites. This diffuse light originates
from stars stripped from galaxies through tidal interactions (Contini
2021; Montes 2022). In this work, we refer to this component as
the intracluster light (hereafter ICL). Recently our team conducted
a detailed study of the ICL in NGC 5098 Paper I, in which we
detected low surface brightness diffuse emission tracing past galaxy-
galaxy interactions and also suggesting a past collision between the
two galaxy groups, a hypothesis that was already suggested by the
kinematical analysis that demonstrated the reality of the NGC 5096
substructure.
In the present work, we aim to model through hydrodynamical
𝑁-body simulations the dynamical history of the possible interaction
between the NGC 5098 and NGC 5096 groups. We also investigate
the excesses in the dark matter distribution and compare them with
our recent results on the ICL distribution Paper I, in order to test the
recent suggestion (e.g. Montes & Trujillo 2019; Kluge et al. 2021)
that the ICL component traces the properties of its host system,
making it a potential tracer of the dark matter.
This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we describe
the simulation setup, including the initial conditions and the range
of dynamical parameters explored. Section 3 presents the results
for our best-fit scenario, beginning with a comparison between the
observed and corrected mock Chandra emissivity maps, followed
by a discussion of how variations in the initial conditions affect
the sloshing signature. Finally, Section 5 summarizes our findings
and provides concluding remarks. We assume a standard ΛCDM
cosmology with ΩΛ = 0.73, Ωm = 0.27, and 𝐻0 = 70 km s−1 Mpc−1.
2 SIMULATION SETUP
In order to model the gas sloshing in NGC 5098 with tailored hy-
drodynamic 𝑁-body simulations, we employed Gadget-4 (Springel
et al. 2021). This galaxy group exhibits sloshing morphology and
edge-like features in both the northeastern and southwestern regions
(Randall et al. 2009), indicative of a past dynamical interaction.
Therefore, a successful model must reproduce the observed sloshing
signatures and recover the locations of these edge-like discontinu-
ities.
2.1 Initial conditions
To model the initial conditions of both galaxy groups, we adopt
analytical density profiles that are widely used in the literature to
describe the dark matter and gas components in equilibrium. For the
dark matter halo, we assume a Hernquist (1990) profile:
𝜌h(𝑟) = 𝑀h
2𝜋
𝑎h
𝑟(𝑟+ 𝑎h)3 ,
(1)
MNRAS 000, 1–10 (2025)
Simulations of NGC 5098 group
3
where 𝑀h is the total dark matter mass and 𝑎h is the scale length.
The corresponding cumulative mass profile is given by:
𝑀(< 𝑟) = 𝑀h
𝑟2
(𝑟+ 𝑎h)2 .
(2)
This profile is particularly suitable for our simulations for several
reasons. In the inner regions, its shape closely resembles that of the
Navarro et al. (1996) (hereafter NFW) profile, which is widely used
to model dark matter halos. However, the Hernquist profile features
a steeper decline at large radii, resulting in a finite total mass. This
property makes it especially advantageous for modelling isolated
systems, as it eliminates the need for an artificial truncation of the
halo.
Given that both profiles are similar at small radii (𝑅≪𝑅200), we
can approximate the Hernquist profile by the NFW profile in this
regime, i.e., 𝜌h ≈𝜌NFW (Springel et al. 2005). This approximation
implies a correspondence between the Hernquist scale length 𝑎h
and the NFW scale radius 𝑟s, where the latter is defined through
the concentration parameter 𝑐. To calculate the scale length for the
Hernquist density profile, we used the following relation:
𝑎h = 𝑟s
√︂
2
h
ln(1 + 𝑐) −
𝑐
1 + 𝑐
i
,
(3)
where 𝑟s is the scale radius of the NFW density profile. Using the
concentration definition, we have 𝑟s = 𝑅200/𝑐. The concentration
parameter 𝑐was estimated using the mass-concentration relation
from Duffy et al. (2008):
𝑐=
6.71
(1 + 𝑧)0.44

𝑀200
2 × 1012 ℎ−1 M⊙
−0.091
,
(4)
which depends only on the halo mass and redshift of the galaxy
group.
To model the density distribution of the IGM in our simulated
galaxy groups collision, we adopted the analytical profile proposed
by Dehnen (1993):
𝜌g(𝑟) = (3 −𝛾)𝑀g
4𝜋
𝑎g
𝑟𝛾(𝑟+ 𝑎g)4−𝛾,
(5)
where 𝑀g is the total gas mass, 𝑎g is the gas scale length, and 𝛾
describes the inner power-law slope of the profile. When 𝛾= 0, the
gas distribution exhibits a flat core (i.e., constant central density),
whereas when 𝛾= 1 the gas distribution is similar to the Hernquist
profile, characterized by a steep central density. In our simulations,
we adopted 𝛾= 1 for NGC 5098, representing a cool-core galaxy
group, and 𝛾= 0 for NGC 5096, corresponding to a non-cool-core
system. This choice is consistent with previous X-ray studies (e.g.,
Xue et al. 2004; Randall et al. 2009).
For the initial condition, we assumed a gas fraction of 𝑓gas = 0.1, a
typical value consistent with the mass range of galaxy groups (Laganá
et al. 2013). Additionally, to determine the gas scale length 𝑎g, we
used the total gas mass and the central gas density, which is defined as
𝜌0 = 𝜇e𝑛e𝑚H, where 𝜇e = 1/(𝑋+ 𝑌
2 ) is the mean molecular weight
per electron. Assuming a primordial abundance with hydrogen and
helium mass fractions 𝑋= 0.76 and𝑌= 0.24, we obtain 𝜇e ≈1.136.
Here, 𝑛e is the electron number density, and 𝑚H is the proton mass.
With these quantities, the scale length can be computed as:
𝑎g = 3𝑀g
4𝜋𝜌0
.

velocity and temperature distributions, can be found in Machado &

Lima Neto (2013). The initial conditions for NGC 5098/5096 were
generated with the following numbers of particles for each of the
galaxy groups: 𝑁DM = 106 for the dark matter and 𝑁gas = 106 for
the gas, using the clustep2 code (Ruggiero & Lima Neto 2017). The
specific parameters adopted for each galaxy group in the simulations
are listed in Table 1.
2.2 Orbital parameters
To investigate the impact of varying individual parameters in our
models on the outcome of the simulations, all simulations were
initialized with the same initial separation. Since the sum of the
virial radii (assuming equal to 𝑅200) of NGC 5098 and NGC 5096
is 0.93 Mpc, we adopted an initial distance of 𝑑= 1.5 Mpc, which
exceeds the combined virial radii and prevents significant overlap of
dark matter and gas particles at the start of the simulations, 𝑡= 0.
By fixing 𝑑, and consequently the initial gravitational potential en-
ergy, we ensure that any differences in the dynamical evolution arise
from changes in other initial parameters, such as the initial infall
velocity and the angle of incidence. A schematic description of the
orbital plane is shown in Fig. 1, where |®𝑣sub| = 𝑣inf is the initial infall
velocity and 𝑖is the angle of incidence.
To identify the best-fitting model, we ran several simulations, vary-
ing the initial conditions as described above. In this work, we present
only the five models that we consider essential for understanding the
dynamics of the NGC 5098/5096 system. These models are crucial
for elucidating the development of edge-like features and the slosh-
ing morphology. The corresponding dynamical parameters are listed
in Table 2.

2.3 X-ray data
X-ray analyses of the system NGC 5098/5096 have been conducted by
Xueet al. (2004); Mahdavietal. (2005);Randalletal. (2009), and Sun
et al. (2009). In this work, we compare our simulation results to the
observed X-ray emission in order to generate a comprehensive model
that explains the dynamical state of NGC 5098/5096. To this end, we
downloaded the three publicly available Chandra observations with
ObsID 2231 (PI Fukazawa; 11 ks), ObsID 3352 (PI Ueda; 2.66 ks),
and ObsID 6941 (PI Buote; 39.13 ks). These datasets were used to
produce exposure-map-corrected images. For the construction of the
radial surface brightness profile, we utilized only the two longer
exposures (11 ks and 39.13 ks).
We reprocessed the Chandra observations following standard pro-
cedures using the CIAO software package and the calibration dataset
CALDB provided by the Chandra X-ray Center (CXC)3. The script
chandra_repro was used with default parameters to reprocess each
observation individually. This task handles the creation of a bad pixel
file, a redistribution matrix file (.rmf), and an ancillary response file
(.arf), using the most up-to-date calibration files while taking the
observation date into account. It then generates a new Type II PHA
(pulse height amplitude) file, the event file that we will use in subse-
quent analysis.
We then combined the reprocessed event files using the
merge_obs script to generate a single, broad-band (0.5–7.0 keV),
exposure-map-corrected image. The exposure pointings are all dif-
ferent, so this task effectively builds a mosaic image, taking into ac-
count the different detectors and their response files. This final image
was used as the basis for extracting radial surface brightness profiles
in the northeastern and southwestern sectors of the NGC 5098 group.
We did not subtract the background, since we will only use surface
brightness ratios (we assume that after the exposure-map correction
the background is flat in the area of the galaxy group).
3 RESULTS
In this work, we present a numerical model that indicates the
NGC 5096 galaxy group as the perturber. Our best model reproduces
the northeast ‘tail’ previously noted by Gastaldello et al. (2007),
which can also be interpreted as the sloshing mentioned in Randall
et al. (2009).
In order to enable a more direct comparison between our simula-
tion results and the observed X-ray emission, we generated realistic
Chandra X-ray mock using the pyXSIM library4 (ZuHone & Hall-
man 2016). pyXSIM implements the PHOX algorithm (Biffi et al.
2012), which simulates photon lists from astrophysical plasma by

convolving the simulated gas radiative properties with instrumen-
tal responses. For each of our best-fitting and comparison models,
we produced synthetic Chandra images in the 0.5 – 7.0 keV band,
adopting an exposure time of 62.79 ks, comparable to the observed
exposure of NGC 5098. We fixed the metallicity at 0.3 𝑍⊙and as-
sumed a hydrogen column density of 𝑛H = 1.34 × 1020 cm−2 (HI4PI
Collaboration et al. 2016) in the direction of NGC 5098. The resulting
corrected mock images were used to extract surface brightness pro-
files and to visually compare sloshing features, providing a consistent
framework for evaluating the fidelity of our dynamical models.
The time evolution of the corrected mock Chandra X-ray emissiv-
ity in the 0.5 – 7.0 keV band throughout the interaction is presented
in Fig. 2, with the last frame corresponding to the current dynami-
cal stage of NGC 5098. The projected (three-dimensional) pericen-
tric distance is approximately 30 kpc (50 kpc), and the time since
pericentric (TSP) passage is estimated to be TSP = 0.50 Gyr. Due
to the relatively small impact parameter, the recent passage of the
NGC 5096 subgroup triggered gas sloshing in the core of the main
group, producing features that are consistent with those observed in
the X-ray data. The simulation is shown with an inclination of 80◦be-
tween the orbital plane and the plane of the sky. This high inclination
is required to reproduce the observed line-of-sight relative velocity
between the galaxy groups. In our numerical experiment, NGC 5096
passes to the east relative to the centre of NGC 5098.
In the first panel of the time evolution of the emissivity shown
in Fig. 2, it is possible to observe NGC 5096 approaching from the
northeast. After the pericentric passage, in the second panel, the
gas associated with NGC 5096 begins to become more diffuse. At
TSP = 0.40 Gyr, the northeastern edge starts to form, and the gas
from NGC 5096 becomes almost indistinguishable from the IGM of
NGC 5098. At TSP = 0.50 Gyr, there is no emissivity peak associated
with NGC 5096, as almost all of its gas has already been stripped by
ram pressure effects. This result agrees with observations, in which

identified by Randall et al. (2009) are marked in white. Right: Smoothed,
corrected mock Chandra image in the same energy band, generated from the
best-matching snapshot of our simulation. The simulated image successfully
reproduces the main morphological features observed in the X-ray data, in-
cluding the northeastern edge-like discontinuity associated with gas sloshing.
NGC 5096 shows only a faint gas peak. The gas originally belonging
to NGC 5096 was dispersed into the IGM after the collision with
NGC 5098. Since galaxies follow the dark matter distribution, in our
analysis the position of NGC 5096 is given by the dark matter peak.
The edge-like discontinuities are formed immediately after the
closest approach of the subgroup. As the perturber passes by, its
gravitational influence displaces the cool, dense gas at the centre
of NGC 5098 from the minimum of the gravitational potential and
transfers angular momentum. This displacement triggers a character-
istic sloshing motion of the intragroup gas, which manifests as sharp
surface brightness discontinuities. These features initially emerge
in the central regions and gradually propagate toward larger radii
as the system continues to evolve dynamically. This process can be
noted in the northeast edge region between TSP = 0.40 Gyr and
TSP = 0.50 Gyr, as shown in Fig. 2.
For both the Chandra and simulated data, we generated the expo-
sure map in the broad band 0.5–7.0 keV. In Fig. 3, we compare the
Chandra image, corrected by the exposure map, with the corrected
mock Chandra image produced from the best-matching snapshot
of our simulation. Each image has been smoothed for display pur-
poses only. In this visual comparison, we note only a faint emission
peak associated with NGC 5096 in the observations. In our simu-
lated model, the gas originally belonging to NGC 5096 was almost
completely stripped by the ram pressure effect, for this reason, no
emissivity peak is present within the cyan circle. In the southwest
sector, Randall et al. (2009) identified an edge region corresponding
to a discontinuity in the brightness profile, which we highlighted
with a semicircular white arc in the left panel of Fig. 3, labeled as
SW Edge. We do not see this discontinuity in the corrected mock
image. To the northeast, we observe the presence of a tail associated
with the sloshing phenomenon, visible in both the observations and
the simulation. This tail, labeled in Fig. 3, appears spontaneously as
a result of the interaction between NGC 5098 and NGC 5096 af-
ter the pericentric passage. The discontinuity in the northeast sector
reported by Randall et al. (2009) was also highlighted with a semicir-
cular line in the exposure-corrected Chandra image. In the corrected
mock image, we can also see a discontinuity in that sector, although
it appears at larger radii.
The comparison between the observed and simulated surface
brightness maps, shown in Fig. 3, indicates that the exposure-
corrected mock image reproduces the main morphological features

and subdivided into 12 bins with logarithmic radial spacing. Source regions
were masked out to extract only the diffuse gas surface brightness radial
profile.
seen in the X-ray data, including the X-ray excess in the northeastern
region and the edge-like discontinuities to the northeast.
We also compare the surface brightness profiles from the X-ray
observations with those derived from our simulated mock Chandra
image in the northeastern and southwestern sectors. By analyzing
the X-ray surface brightness of NGC 5098 from the combined Chan-
dra observations, edge-like discontinuities were identified and can
be associated with gas sloshing. To compare our simulation results
with the observations, we defined a sector similar, though not iden-
tical, to that used in Randall et al. (2009). As shown in Fig. 4, we
defined one sector to the northeast and another to the southwest,
each subdivided into 12 bins. For the observations, the sectors were
centred on NGC 5098a, which coincides with the central emission
peak. In the simulations, we centred the sectors on the simulated
emission peak as well, to enable a more consistent comparison. The
ratio was computed between the excess in each semicircular annulus
and the average surface brightness of the respective sector. This same
procedure was applied to both the observed Chandra data and the
simulated mock images.
As shown in Fig. 5, the profile in the northeastern sector exhibits
good agreement between the simulation and the observations, with
the mean value of the simulated surface brightness lying within the
observational uncertainties across the radial range. This agreement
demonstrates that our model accurately reproduces the main features
associated with the gas distribution, including the sloshing, observed
in NGC 5098. In our simulation, the northeastern edge is detected
at a radius of 93 kpc, which is larger than the previously reported
value. In the X-ray data, we observe only a slight decrease in the
mean surface brightness at 𝑟∼56 kpc. This result, derived from
our simulated model, suggests that the sloshing northeastern edge in
NGC 5098 may actually lie at a larger radius than the one detected
by Randall et al. (2009).

ern sector for both the X-ray observations and the corrected mock Chandra
image. The vertical dashed line indicates the position of the surface brightness
discontinuity reported by Randall et al. (2009) at 𝑟= 56 kpc, as highlighted
in Fig. 3. The same extraction sector is applied over an extended radial range.
Bottom panel: Same as the top panel, but for the southwestern sector. In this
case, the vertical dashed line marks a radius of 𝑟= 31 kpc. The orange shaded
area indicates the 1𝜎confidence interval.
For the southwestern sector, the mean value of our numerical
model does not fully reproduce the observed surface brightness pro-
file at certain radii. In the central region, this difference can be
attributed to the presence of an AGN at the centre of NGC 5098.
AGN jets inject energy into the IGM, heating the surrounding gas
and inflating cavities or bubbles that appear as localized depressions
in the X-ray surface brightness. These bubble regions are located to
the north and southeast of the AGN. In the NGC 5098 group, these
regions also exhibit associated radio emission that fills the X-ray
cavities (see Randall et al. 2009, for further details). When the con-
fidence interval of the numerical model is taken into account, our
best-fitting scenario remains consistent with the X-ray data, even in
the absence of AGN feedback in the simulation.
Since we simulate the gravitational hydrodynamical interaction
of a binary collision between two galaxy groups without including
galaxies or feedback processes, our model cannot capture possible
AGN-driven features in the central region. Additionally, the model
only recovers the edge feature reported at 𝑟= 31 kpc when the
confidence interval is taken into account (see Fig. 5). This surface
brightness drop could be associated with older AGN bubbles, as
suggested by the cavitiesvisible nearthe southwesternedgein figure 3
of Randall et al. (2009). Alternatively, a substructure with a galaxy-
scale mass could also induce a discontinuity in that region of the
group. Although there is a region between 𝑟= 20 kpc and 𝑟= 30 kpc
where the surface brightness decreases slightly more gradually, this
variation is not sufficient to be classified as an edge-like feature.
Finally, from our best-fitting model, we obtained a line-of-sight rel-
ative velocity of 716 km s−1, which is comparable to the ∼700 km s−1
estimated from the observations, and a projected distance of 160 kpc,
which is very close to the observed value of 155 kpc, further sup-
porting the consistency of our model with the observational data.
4 DISCUSSION
In the following, we discuss the impact of variations in key pa-
rameters, such as the initial infall velocity and the angle of in-
cidence, which are directly related to the impact parameter of
the NGC 5098/5096 system. We also explore the possibility that
NGC 5098b may be responsible for the observed sloshing, and we
compare the distribution of dark matter with the ICL to examine the
alignment between these two components.
4.1 Exploring the initial-condition parameter space
We performed a systematic exploration of the initial-condition pa-
rameter space to obtain a simulated model capable of explaining
the dynamical scenario of NGC 5098. Our goal is to reproduce the
sloshing signatures and obtain a surface brightness profile consistent
with the observations. To this end, we tested different collision sce-
narios by varying key parameters. In this section, we discuss some
of the crucial parameters explored, which have a direct impact on the
resulting numerical model.
To enable a consistent comparison between models, we initialized
each simulation with the same separation of 𝑑= 1.5 Mpc between
the two galaxy groups, which exceeds the sum of their virial radii
(𝑅200 of NGC 5098 plus 𝑅200 of NGC 5096). Ensuring that the initial
distance is larger than the combined virial radii prevents any prema-
ture gravitational overlap or tidal interaction at 𝑡= 0 Gyr. By fixing
this initial separation, all models start with the same gravitational
potential energy, allowing us to isolate and compare the effects of
varying infall velocity and impact parameter.
In the top panels of Fig. 6, we show two simulations at a fixed
angle of incidence of 𝑖= 5◦, varying only the initial infall veloc-
ity. Specifically, one run uses 𝑣inf = 350 km s−1 and the other uses
𝑣inf = 950 km s−1. By keeping the separation fixed at 𝑑= 1.5 Mpc
and the angle of incidence constant, any differences in the result-
ing sloshing morphology can be directly attributed to the change in
infall speed. This comparison highlights how sensitive the sloshing
signature is to the galaxy groups relative velocity. Comparing both
models, we find that lower initial infall velocities give the system
more time to reach the expected projected separation, leading to a
more developed sloshing pattern. For reference, a zero-energy orbit
would have implied a relative velocity of 485 km s−1 in the initial
conditions. This idealized estimate corresponds to the free-fall ve-
locity of two point masses released from infinity. Thus, the different
initial relative velocities in the simulations cover a range from 0.7 to
2 of the free-fall velocity. Due to the relatively low gas temperature,
the sound speed in the intracluster medium, in the regions of interest,
is in the range 350–500 km s−1, which implies supersonic speeds,
even more so at the pericentric passage.
Since we fixed the total potential energy of the system, the 𝑣inf =
350 km s−1 model begins with lower initial kinetic energy, resulting
in a closer pericentric passage and an impact parameter 𝑏= 63 kpc.
In this case, a clear X-ray brightness discontinuity appears in the
northeastern sector. By contrast, the 𝑣inf = 950 km s−1 model, which
results in 𝑏= 100 kpc, shows no such discontinuity. This difference is
evident in Fig. 7, where the surface brightness profiles are compared.
Specifically, at a radius of 118 kpc, the northeast brightness profile
in the 𝑣inf = 350 km s−1 model shows a discontinuity. In the higher-
velocity scenario, however, the brightness declines smoothly at larger
radii, without forming a sharp edge.
In Fig. 8, the left panel shows the trajectories of NGC 5096 for
each scenario. Each collision scenario was run until the two groups
reached a projected separation of approximately 150 kpc; we also

ferent infall velocities, keeping the initial angle of incidence of 5◦. Bot-
tom panels: Comparison between simulations with a fixed infall velocity of
650 km s−1 and varying the angle of incidence. Our best-fitting model, shown
in Fig. 3, corresponds to 𝑣inf = 650 km s−1 and 𝑖= 5◦. All models are pro-
jected assuming an inclination of 80◦between the orbital plane and the plane
of the sky. The circle indicates the position of the NGC 5096 galaxy group.
rotated the orbital plane to align NGC 5096 with its observed direc-
tion in the plane of the sky. We estimate the impact parameter from
the minimum three-dimensional separation between NGC 5098 and
NGC 5096, which occurs at TSP = 0 Gyr. The middle panel presents
the projected separation as a function of TSP; due to line-of-sight
effects, the minimum projected distance may occur at TSP ≠0 Gyr.
Turning to the southwestern sector, the mean value of the lower-
velocity scenario exhibits a significant mismatch in the surface
brightness profile, whereas the higher-velocity scenario more closely
follows the observational trend, similar to our best-fitting model.
However, when the confidence interval is taken into account, both
models remain consistent with the observations. Nevertheless, we
discard both collision scenarios due to their inconsistency with the
observed line-of-sight relative velocity. For the 𝑣inf = 350 km s−1
model, the line-of-sight relative velocity, after applying an incli-
nation of 80◦between the orbital plane and the plane of the sky,
is 𝑣los = 474 km s−1, which is lower than the ∼700 km s−1 in-
ferred from observations. In contrast, the 𝑣inf = 950 km s−1 model
yields 𝑣los = 962 km s−1, exceeding the expected value. Therefore,
both scenarios fail to reproduce the kinematics of the NGC 5098
system. Our best-fitting model, with 𝑣inf = 650 km s−1, produces
𝑣los = 716 km s−1, which closely matches the observed velocity.
Fixing the initial potential and kinetic energies, we varied the
angle of incidence to 0◦and 10◦. For 𝑖= 0◦, the impact parameter is
𝑏≈0 kpc, as shown by the dark gray points crossing the origin in the
left panel of Fig. 8, where NGC 5098 is located. In this configuration,
the line-of-sight relative velocity is 𝑣los = 522 km s−1, which is lower
than the observed value. For 𝑖= 10◦, the impact parameter increases
to 𝑏= 131 kpc, and we obtain 𝑣los = 683 km s−1. From a kinematic
perspective, both configurations are able to reproduce the observed
line-of-sight relative velocity of the NGC 5098 system.
When comparing the surface brightness profiles in Fig. 7, the 𝑖=
0◦model shows a brightness distribution that deviates significantly
from the observations, even when the confidence interval is taken
into account. Moreover, this model fails to reproduce the sloshing
signature in the simulated mock Chandra emissivity map, as shown
in Fig. 6. In contrast, the 𝑖= 10◦model provides a fit similar to
our best-fitting case; however, it does not produce an edge in the
northeastern sector.
Overall, comparing our models, we find that collisions with smaller
impact parameters are more effective at producing an edge-like fea-
ture in the northeastern sector. Models with initial infall velocities
below 𝑣inf = 350 km s−1 fail to reproduce the observed velocity and
edge position, even when large inclination angles between the line
of sight and the orbital plane are applied. For the NGC 5098/5096
minor merger, with a mass ratio of 1:20, even head-on encounters
with impact parameter 𝑏≈0 did not lead to any disruption of the
cool core in the NGC 5098 galaxy group.
4.2 NGC 5098b as an alternative perturber
The sloshing arm detected by Randall et al. (2009) appears as an
X-ray emission excess to the north of NGC 5098b, spiraling outward
in a clockwise pattern. This sloshing feature was attributed to the
gravitational influence of NGC 5098b on NGC 5098a, the domi-
nant galaxy in the group. In our orbital interpretation, a clockwise
spiral requires the perturber to have approached from the northeast.
The two galaxies are separated by a projected distance of 27 kpc,
and spectroscopic redshifts indicate a line-of-sight relative velocity
difference of 𝑣los = 400 km s−1.
To reproduce these observational constraints, we initialized a col-
lision scenario in which NGC 5098b starts at a distance of 1.5 Mpc
from NGC 5098a, varying both the initial infall velocity and the an-
gle of incidence. We then rotated the system to match the observed
projected separation and line-of-sight velocity at the best-fitting mo-
ment. In this configuration, however, no tail formation was observed
to the northeast of NGC 5098. The absence of a prominent slosh-
ing feature suggests that NGC 5098b is unlikely to be the primary
perturber of the NGC 5098/5096 system.
As discussed in section 3, when the NGC 5096 galaxy group
is instead considered as the main perturber, key features such as
the tail morphology and the radial surface brightness profile are
successfully reproduced. Therefore, although we cannot entirely rule
out the possibility that NGC 5098b acted as the main perturber, our
simulations indicate that this scenario is improbable.
4.3 Comparison between dark matter distribution and
intragroup light
Some authors suggest (e.g. Montes & Trujillo 2019; Kluge et al.
2021) that the ICL component typically aligns with host cluster
properties, which makes it a potential dark matter tracer. Montes
& Trujillo (2019) conducted morphological comparisons between
ICL and dark matter, finding the ICL better than X-ray emission for
tracing the total mass in central regions of Hubble Frontier Field clus-
ters. Similarly, Alonso Asensio et al. (2020) using Cluster-EAGLE
simulations confirm the correlation between ICL and total mass,
despite radial density profiles showing mismatches.
After obtaining a best-fitting collision scenario, we compare our
simulation results with recent analyses of the ICL Paper I to check

whether a correlation between dark matter and ICL also arises in our
scenario. To this end, we compare the residual image of the simulated
dark matter distribution with the observed ICL map.
The top-left panel of Fig. 9 shows the simulated dark matter distri-
bution. We adapted the parameters of the GALFIT code (Peng et al.
2002) to fit a Nuker profile (Lauer et al. 1995) to the dark matter ha-
los of both NGC 5098 and NGC 5096. The resulting GALFIT model
is shown in the top-right panel. By subtracting this model from our
best-fitting simulation, we obtain the residual image shown in the
bottom-left panel. For comparison, the bottom-right panel presents
the 𝑔-band residual image from Paper I, which highlights the ICL
after stellar light subtraction.
We identify an excess of dark matter to the northeast of NGC 5098,
highlighted by a semicircular annulus, which spatially coincides with
an enhancement of the ICL in the same region. Similarly, another
slight excess is found to the southwest of NGC 5098, also aligned
with an ICL overdensity. Additionally, an excess of dark matter is
found to the southeast of NGC 5096; however, in this case, we are
not certain whether it is comparable to the ICL in the same re-
gion. This uncertainty arises because the diffuse light to the south of
NGC 5096 may correspond to a tidal dwarf galaxy or to the remnant
of a galaxy disrupted by tidal forces, as suggested by Paper I, and is
not necessarily related to the NGC 5098/5096 interaction.
Comparing the ICL morphology with the dark matter density in
Fig. 9, we find a correlation between the two distributions, whose
origin could be related to the NGC 5098/5096 interaction. However,
the residual image derived from the dark matter distribution does not
reproduce all the individual ICL features reported in Paper I.

5 CONCLUSIONS
We have conducted tailored hydrodynamic 𝑁-body simulations of
the NGC 5098/5096 system aiming to reproduce the observed gas
sloshing morphology in the NGC 5098 galaxy group. By systemat-
ically exploring the initial condition parameter space, we identified
the range of key parameters that best reproduce the observational
data. Our results support the scenario in which NGC 5096 acts as the
perturber, in agreement with our X-ray analysis. The main conclu-
sions are summarized below:
(i) NGC 5096 as the primary perturber. Our simulations
demonstrate that even a relatively low mass substructure can trig-
ger gas sloshing in an intermediate mass galaxy group. Attempts
to reproduce the sloshing signature by placing the perturber at
the location of NGC 5098b (27 kpc east) were unsuccessful. In-
stead, adopting NGC 5096 as the perturber yields our best-fitting
model, which reproduces the projected separation in the plane
of the sky (𝑑proj = 160 kpc), the line-of-sight relative velocity
(𝑣los = 716 km s−1), and the characteristic northeastern sloshing fea-
ture. Although this idealized model does not include AGN feedback,
whose jets can create cavities that depress the X-ray surface bright-
ness, our simulated brightness profile still matches the observations
in the southwestern sector when the confidence interval is taken into
account.
(ii) Sensitivity to impact parameter. Our comparison of col-
lision scenarios reveals that smaller impact parameters more ef-
fectively induce sloshing and generate edge-like discontinuities in
the northeastern sector of NGC 5098. While a head-on collision
(𝑏= 0 kpc) represents an extreme case, our best-fitting model re-
quires an impact parameter of 𝑏= 50 kpc to reproduce the key
morphological features of the northeastern edge. In contrast, when
we fix the initial infall velocity at 𝑣inf = 650 km s−1 and increase
the angle of incidence to 𝑖= 10◦, the resulting impact parameter
(𝑏= 131 kpc) is too large to produce a clear edge-like feature in
the northeast; however, sloshing motions remain evident in the gas
distribution.
(iii) Sensitivity to initial infall velocity. We tested three sce-
narios with varying initial infall velocities. Models with 𝑣inf <
350 km s−1 cannot reach the observed line-of-sight relative veloc-
ity of ∼700 km s−1, even when high orbital inclinations are applied.
On the other hand, models with 𝑣inf > 950 km s−1 produce line-
of-sight relative velocities that exceed the observed value. We also
explored lower inclination angles; in those cases, the sloshing feature
in the northeastern sector does not have sufficient time to develop
before the system reaches the observed projected separation.
(iv) Intracluster light (ICL) comparison. In our collision sce-
nario, we find that the residual dark matter distribution roughly fol-
lows the same general morphology as observed in the ICL distribution
obtained from observations. The diffuse light distribution in certain
regions appears to be related to the NGC 5098/5096 interaction, al-
though we were not able to reproduce all individual ICL features
reported in previous analyses.
Modelling galaxy groups in the literature is not common. This
task is particularly challenging because even a single galaxy can
perturb the IGM and non-gravitational processes such as AGN feed-
back can generate cavities that complicate the interpretation of the
collision scenario. Our work demonstrates that the gravitational in-
teraction with NGC 5096 provides a coherent explanation for the
sloshing features in NGC 5098. Future efforts incorporating AGN
feedback and more complex group environments will further refine
our understanding of gas dynamics in galaxy groups.
