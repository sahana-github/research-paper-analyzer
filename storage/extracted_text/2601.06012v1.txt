Abstract— In Differential GNSS (DGNSS) positioning, dif-
ferencing measurements between a user and a reference station
suppresses common-mode errors but also introduces reference-
station noise, which fundamentally limits accuracy. This limitation
is minor for high-grade stations but becomes significant when using
reference infrastructure of mixed quality. This paper investigates
how large-scale user cooperation can mitigate the impact of
reference-station noise in conventional (non-cooperative) DGNSS
systems. We develop a unified estimation framework for cooperative
DGNSS (C-DGNSS) and cooperative real-time kinematic (C-RTK)
positioning, and derive parameterized expressions for their Fisher
information matrices as functions of network size, satellite geometry,
and reference-station noise. This formulation enables theoretical
analysis of estimation performance, identifying regimes where
cooperation asymptotically restores the accuracy of DGNSS with
an ideal (noise-free) reference. Simulations validate these theoretical
findings.

Global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) remains
the cornerstone of outdoor navigation, providing globally
accessible, reliable, and drift-free positioning capabili-

Fig. 1: Overview of the cooperative DGNSS architecture considered in
this work. Nearby users r ∈1, . . . , N transmit code (ρr) and carrier-
phase (Φr) measurements to a CPC, which jointly processes them
with base-station DGNSS corrections. Cooperation is centralized, base-
station–anchored, and does not involve inter-user ranging.
of code measurements and residual biases arising from
imperfect orbit and atmospheric modeling [4, Ch. 21].
While meter-level accuracy is sufficient for most con-
sumer applications, emerging domains such as intelligent
transportation systems and vehicle-to-everything (V2X)
communications [5], [6] demand centimeter-level preci-
sion [7], [8]. Precise point positioning (PPP) [4, Ch. 25]
offers a means to achieve such accuracy by incorpo-
rating precise orbit and clock corrections; however, its
long convergence time limits its suitability for real-time
applications [9], [10].
Real-time precise positioning is enabled by differential
GNSS (DGNSS) [4, Ch. 26]. In this architecture, profes-
sionally maintained continuously operating reference sta-
tions (CORSs) at surveyed locations [31, Ch. 6] broadcast
corrections that mitigate errors common to both the ref-
erence station and nearby user receivers [32]. Code-based
DGNSS implementations rely exclusively on pseudorange
measurements, typically achieving decimeter-level accu-
racy. Further incorporating carrier-phase measurements,
real-time kinematic (RTK) resolves integer ambiguities
and enables centimeter-level precision [33, Ch. 2].
Remarkably, most reference networks are proprietary
and managed by national or private operators, prompting
growing efforts to make precise positioning more widely
accessible [34]. This includes the emergence of low-
cost GNSS receivers supporting RTK- and PPP-level
capabilities [35]–[37], efforts by commercial providers to
broaden access to precise correction services [38], and
public services offering openly accessible real-time PPP
corrections. The latter includes CNES products [39] and
the Galileo High Accuracy Service (HAS) [40].
Within this ongoing democratization of precise posi-
tioning, we identify achieving CORS-grade performance
using low-cost reference infrastructure as a key research
objective. While low-cost receivers reduce deployment
costs, their limited hardware quality degrades the accuracy
of DGNSS and RTK corrections. One approach to address
this challenge is to leverage the growing availability

TABLE I: Overview of representative GNSS cooperative positioning approaches by measurement source; see [11] for a broad survey. We focus
on the C-DGNSS and C-RTK methodologies (blue row), which rely on GNSS measurements differenced with those of a surveyed base station,
without using auxiliary sensing.

User-anchor constraint formation to cancel common
errors
Yes, typically through the reference
entity
of data-sharing infrastructures and employ cooperative
positioning (CP) techniques [11] (see Sec. II for a brief
review). When multiple receivers rely on a common
reference station for DGNSS corrections, their differential
observations become statistically correlated through the
shared reference noise. Accounting for these correlations,
which are particularly pronounced when low-cost refer-
ence stations are used, enhances positioning accuracy.
In this work, we adopt an estimation-theoretic per-
spective to address the following questions: Can large-
scale user cooperation compensate for the reference-
station noise propagated through the differencing oper-
ation in standard (non-cooperative) DGNSS? If so, under
which conditions, and to what extent? The main contribu-
tions of this paper, relative to our prior conference works
in which the potential of this cooperative positioning
approach was preliminarily explored [29], [30], are:
• We present a unified estimation framework for coop-
erative differential GNSS that integrates both code-
and carrier-phase-based techniques and accounts for
a reference station with arbitrary noise variance.
• We provide a comprehensive theoretical analysis of
the asymptotic performance of cooperative DGNSS
(C-DGNSS) [30] and cooperative RTK (C-RTK) [29]
based on the Fisher information matrix (FIM), and as
a function of receiver count, satellite visibility, and
measurement variance.
• We validate the proposed framework through simula-
tions representative of multi-user network scenarios,
such as the one illustrated in Fig. 1.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows:
Sec. II reviews related work; Sec. III formalizes the C-
DGNSS and C-RTK methodologies; Sec. IV analyzes
their theoretical performance limits; Sec. V presents the
simulation results; and Sec. VI concludes the paper.
II. Background on GNSS Cooperative Positioning
This section outlines representative approaches to
GNSS CP as summarized in Table I, and introduces
the cooperative architecture considered in this work, as
illustrated in Fig. 1.
Interest in GNSS CP emerged in the early 2000s [41],
driven by advances in wireless sensor networks and
short-range communication technologies that enabled in-
formation exchange among receivers [42]. Notably, CP
was originally developed for mass-market and indoor
environments, where external positioning infrastructure
was scarce and devices had to rely on inter-receiver
cooperation to overcome low SNR and limited transmitter
availability [43], [44]. Since the late 2010s, renewed
attention has been fueled by the availability of raw GNSS
measurements on mass-market devices [15], [45]–[47]
and the rise of V2X communications [48], [49].
A well-established approach is DGNSS-CP [12]–[14],
which operates without any reference by differencing the
measurements of multiple receivers to cancel common-
mode errors and infer inter-agent ranges [11, §IV.C].
These cooperative ranges can then be incorporated as
additional constraints in the PVT solver [15], [16], thereby
improving absolute positioning for users with limited
satellite visibility [15], [17].
On the other hand, hybrid GNSS CP directly pro-
cesses raw GNSS measurements while integrating relative
information from independent ranging technologies [18],
[19]. This includes inter-receiver ranges obtained from
received signal strength (RSS) or time of arrival (TOA)
measurements, with the former being highly sensitive to
the environment. When implemented with ultra-wideband
(UWB) technology, TOA ranging can achieve centimeter-
level accuracy [50]. Remarkably, some works use vision-
based or other relative-pose sensing modalities that pro-
vide vector-valued constraints, substantially strengthening
network observability [20]. Theoretical analysis of hybrid
architectures was first formalized in [21], and [18] intro-
duced the CDOP metric to demonstrate the benefits of
increased network connectivity and geometric diversity.
Some methods anchor network positioning to a global
frame through reference points (also referred to as
network anchors) or position initialization for selected
users [22]–[24]. Our previous work introduced a mas-
sive differentiation method [27], in which a target user
forms differential measurements with neighboring re-
ceivers whose positions are modeled via probabilistic
priors, allowing these neighbors to act as virtual refer-
ences. Under the assumption that such priors are zero-
mean and hence unbiased, the method achieves asymp-
totic DGNSS/RTK-level performance without requiring a
physical base station [28].

contribution of this work. Solid arrows indicate section flow, while dashed arrows denote result reuse across derivations.
Cooperative Differential GNSS Architecture: In
this work, we consider a C-DGNSS [30] and C-RTK [29]
architecture, where the network comprises one surveyed
reference station (indexed by b) and N user receivers (in-
dexed by r ∈{1, . . . , N}). The reference station observes
a set of K satellites (indexed by s ∈{p, 1, . . . , K−1}),
where p denotes the pivot satellite used for differencing.
Each user receiver observes all or a subset of these
satellites depending on visibility. Cooperation is real-
ized through centralized processing: all receivers (and
the reference station) share their raw code and carrier-
phase measurements with a common central processing
center (CPC), which performs joint state estimation. Im-
portantly, there is no inter-user ranging; all differential
measurements are formed between each user and the
reference station, providing a shared differencing anchor
and enabling explicit modeling of inter-measurement cor-
relations across the network.
Addressing multipath and non-line-of-sight (NLOS)
effects in CP remains challenging, as these depend
strongly on each user’s local geometry and environment,
thus leading to largely uncorrelated measurements [11,
§IV.B]. Map-aided [26] and machine-learning-based [51]
methods show promise, with some exploiting spatial
correlations among users in similar geometries [46] or
benefiting from sensor integration [52]. This work instead
targets the mitigation of atmospheric effects that are com-
mon to all receivers and to the low-cost reference station
operating under short-baseline conditions (typically <10
km). Multipath, NLOS, privacy preservation [53], and
time-synchronization issues [15] fall outside the scope
of this paper. Robustness to outliers in the C-DGNSS
framework is investigated in [54].
III. Cooperative DGNSS and RTK Methodologies
This section presents a unified estimation framework
for the C-DGNSS and C-RTK methodologies under a
reference station with arbitrary noise variance, covering
their linearized observation models (Sec. III-A) as well
as the associated estimation problem and performance
bounds (Sec. III-B). The reader should refer to Fig. 2
for an overview of this section.
Notation: Bold lowercase and uppercase letters de-
note vector- and matrix-valued quantities, respectively,
while regular lowercase letters denote scalars. The all-
ones vector is 1p ∈Rp; Ip is the p × p identity matrix;
the matrices 1p,q, 0p,q ∈Rp×q contain ones and zeros,
respectively, with the shorthand 1p ≜1p,p and 0p ≜0p,p;
⊗is the Kronecker product; and ∇x(·) denotes the
gradient w.r.t. x.
A.
Observation Models
In this section, we formulate the C-DGNSS and C-
RTK methodologies within a unified Gaussian model:
y|θ ∼N(m(θ), Σ), θT = [ωT, zT],
(1)
where y ∈RMy represents the measurement vector,
and θ ∈RMθ is the unknown (deterministic) parameter
vector, composed of continuous parameters ω ∈RMω and
integer parameters z ∈ZMz, such that Mθ = Mω + Mz.
The function m(θ) ∈RMy and Σ ∈RMy×My are the
measurement model mean and covariance.
We adopt the following simplifying assumptions, until
otherwise stated in Sec. IV-A:
A1) All users r ∈{1, . . . , N} and the base station track
the same set of K satellites s ∈{p, 1, . . . , K−1}.
A2) The stochastic measurement models share a common
structure across users.
A3) Users are in close proximity, implying identical
satellite–receiver line-of-sight (LOS) vectors across
the network.
We next derive the explicit forms of θ, m(θ), and Σ
for the C-DGNSS and C-RTK models, as summarized
in Table II. The derivation follows four steps, each
detailed in Secs. III-A.2 through III-A.5: (1) definition
and linearization of the single-user observation model;
(2) introducing a compact notation to stack all network
observations; (3) applying the single difference (SD)
operator with respect to the reference station to obtain
the C-DGNSS model (Definition 1); and (4) extending to
the double difference (DD) case by selecting a reference
satellite, yielding the C-RTK model (Definition 2). Note
that expanded formulations are provided in Sec. S1 of the
Supplemental Material.
1.
Definition of Cooperative Operators
We first introduce three operators that compactly
represent the stacking and differencing operations used in
the subsequent derivations. Throughout this section, let m
denote the dimension of the vector to which stacking or
differencing has been applied. In practice, m is either the

number of satellites (for measurement differencing) or the
state-vector dimension.
a) Cooperative Stacking Operator: To stack the ob-
servations from the full network, we define
˜u ≜[ u⊤
b , u⊤
1 , . . . , u⊤
N ]⊤∈Rm(N+1),
(2)
with ui ∈Rm denoting an arbitrary vector associated
with either the reference station (i = b) or a user receiver
(i ∈{1, . . . , N}).
b) Cooperative SD Operator: With respect to the
reference station b, we define
˜ub ≜˜Db˜u =

u⊤
b1, . . . , u⊤
bN
⊤∈RmN,
(3)
where ubr ≜ur −ub ∈Rm, ∀r ∈{1, . . . , N}, denotes the
per-user SD quantity, and the SD matrix has the form
˜Db = [−1N ⊗Im, IN ⊗Im] ∈RmN×m(N+1).
(4)
c) Cooperative DD Operator: With respect to a pivot
satellite p, we define
˜up
b ≜˜Dp˜ub =

(up
b1)⊤, . . . , (up
bN)⊤⊤∈R(m−1)N,

b) ∈R the per-user per-satellite
differentiation scalar. The DD matrices are defined as
˜Dp = IN ⊗Dp ∈R(m−1)N×mN,
Dp = [−1m−1, Im−1] ∈R(m−1)×m.
(6)
Note that the one-user DD matrix, Dp, has already been
presented in the literature [4, Ch. 26].
2. Single-User Model
At a given epoch, receiver r measures the pseudorange
and carrier phase with respect to satellite s as
ρs
r = ϱs
r + T s
r + Is
r + c(dtr −dts) + εs
r ∈R,
Φs
r = ϱs
r + T s
r −Is
r + c(dtr −dts) + λN s
r + ϵs
r ∈R, (7)
where ϱs
r ≜∥ps −pr∥denotes the true satellite–receiver
range, with ps and pr being the satellite and receiver
position vectors; dts and dtr are the satellite and receiver
clock offsets; c is the speed of light; εs
r and ϵs
r represent
unmodeled errors (e.g., thermal noise, multipath, atmo-
spheric residuals, ephemeris errors); Is
r and T s
r denote
the ionospheric and tropospheric delays; λ is the carrier
wavelength; and N s
r is the integer ambiguity [33, Ch. 2].
For simplicity, we omit frequency and time reference
labels and neglect ephemeris errors.
For receiver r, the state vector collecting the unknown
position and clock offset parameters is given by
xr = [p⊤
r , c dtr]⊤∈R4,
δxr ≜xr −xr,0,
(8)
where xr,0 denotes the linearization (assumed reference)
state used below.
To obtain a locally linear and tractable model, the true
range ϱs
r is linearized with respect to pr by a first-order
Taylor expansion around the initial estimate pr,0:
ϱs
r ≈∥ps −pr,0∥−(es
r)⊤δpr,
(9)
being δpr = pr−pr,0 the position linearization increment,
and es
r = −(ps −pr,0)/∥ps −pr,0∥the satellite–receiver
LOS unit vector. For brevity, the dependence of es
r on
pr,0 is omitted in the notation.
Substituting the linearized range into (7) and ex-
pressing the result in observed-minus-computed (O-C)
form yield the following pseudorange and carrier-phase
residuals for receiver r over the full set of K visible
satellites [4, Ch. 21]:
∆ρr = Hr δxr + c dt + Tr + Ir + εr ∈RK,
∆Φr = Hr δxr + c dt + Tr −Ir + λNr + ϵr ∈RK,
(10)
where Hr = [Er, 1K] ∈RK×4 is the observation model
matrix, with Er = −[e1
r, . . . , eK
r ]⊤denoting the geometry
matrix. Under Assumption A3, Er = E and Hr = H for
all r. The term c dt includes only the satellite clock, as
the receiver clock is included in the state.
Note that the above single-frequency model can be
extended to the multi-frequency case by stacking obser-
vations across frequencies and augmenting the state vector
with the corresponding carrier-phase ambiguities.
3.
Multi-User Model
Applying the stacking operator in (2) to (10) yields
the full-network O-C measurement equations:
∆˜ρ = ˜HN+1δ˜x + c ˜dt + ˜T + ˜I + ˜ε ∈RK(N+1),
∆˜Φ = ˜HN+1δ˜x + c ˜dt + ˜T −˜I + λ ˜N + ˜ϵ ∈RK(N+1),
(11)
with ˜HN = IN ⊗H. For clarity, we explicitly write the
following stacked quantities, based on (2), as
∆˜ρ ≜[ ∆ρ⊤
b , ∆ρ⊤
1 , . . . , ∆ρ⊤
N ]⊤∈RK(N+1),
δ˜x ≜[ δx⊤
b , δx⊤
1 , . . . , δx⊤
N ]⊤∈R4(N+1).
The same stacking convention applies to all other tilded
quantities in (11).
Note that the stacked residual vector [ ∆˜ρ⊤, ∆˜Φ⊤]⊤
has an associated error vector ˜η = [ ˜ε⊤, ˜ϵ⊤]⊤with
covariance
˜Σ = E{˜η ˜ηT} =
 ˜Σρ
˜Σρ,Φ
˜ΣΦ,ρ
˜ΣΦ

∈R2K(N+1)×2K(N+1).
(12)
Here, ˜Σρ = diag(Σρ,b, Σρ,1, . . . , Σρ,N), with Σρ,r =
σ2
ρ,rW−1
r
being the pseudorange covariance of receiver r,
σ2
ρ,r the known nominal pseudorange-noise variance. An
analogous definition applies to ˜ΣΦ. The cross-covariance
terms in (12) are typically assumed to be negligible,
except for baselines above 50 km [33, Ch. 2]. Finally, the
diagonal weighting matrix Wr follows standard GNSS
variance models based on satellite elevation [55] or signal-
to-noise ratio [56].
4.
Cooperative DGNSS Model (code-only)
The full-network SD measurement equations are ob-
tained by applying the SD operator in (3) to (11) as
∆˜ρb = ˜Db ∆˜ρ = ˜HN δ˜xb + ˜εb ∈RKN,

∆˜Φb = ˜Db ∆˜Φ = ˜HN δ˜xb + λ ˜Nb + ˜ϵb ∈RKN,

DEFINITION 1 (C-DGNSS Model). Having introduced
all relevant terms, we now present the complete C-DGNSS
observation model (see Table II):
∆˜ρb|δ˜xb ∼N( ˜HN δ˜xb, ˜Σb,ρ), δ˜xb ∈R4N.
(16)
Here, δxbi = δxi −δxb
(a)
= δxi, where (a) uses xb = xb,0
(surveyed base) ⇒δxb = 0. Hence, in C-DGNSS, the
relative state increment reduces to the user’s absolute one
as δxbi = [ δp⊤
bi, c δtbi ]⊤(a)
= [ δp⊤
i , c δti ]⊤.
5. Cooperative RTK Model (code and phase)
Applying the DD operator in (5) to (13) gives the
full-network DD measurement equations as

b ∈R(K−1)N
where, beyond the single-difference error cancelation
in (13), double differencing cancels receiver clock offsets.
Here, ˜EN = IN ⊗E, and we use the shorthands ˜b = δ˜pb
and ˜a = ˜Np
b to denote the network-wide baseline vector
and the vector of integer ambiguities, respectively. Note
that, following the DD operator in (5), we have

sions for the C-DGNSS and C-RTK models, which under-
pin the theoretical derivations in Section IV.
Let us assume that all receivers share identical er-
ror characteristics, i.e., σ2

Wr = W ∀r ∈{1, . . . , N}, leading to Σρ = σ2

have a different error variance: σ2

B. Estimators and Performance Bounds
This section presents the C-DGNSS (Sec. III-B.1)
and C-RTK (Sec. III-B.2) estimators, along with their
corresponding Cram´er-Rao bound (CRB), which provides
a theoretical lower bound on estimation variance.
It is convenient to express the FIM of the two models
under study in a unified form as
J(ω) = ˜GT ˜R−1 ˜G,
(29)
where the model-specific definitions of ˜G and ˜R are
summarized in Table III.
REMARK 2 (Solvability condition). A sufficient condition
for the least squares solution is that the total number of
independent measurements must be greater than or equal
to the number of unknowns in the system. For the C-
DGNSS and C-RTK estimators, this corresponds to [18]
PN
r=1 Kr ≥4N, where Kr ≤K denotes the number of
satellites visible to user r. This condition is guaranteed
to be satisfied if every user in the scenario has visibility
to at least 4 satellites.
1. Cooperative DGNSS Estimator and Bound
Following the code-only observation model in (16),
and if the condition in Remark 2 is met, C-DGNSS can be
formulated as a weighted least squares (WLS) problem:
ˆω = arg min
ˆω∈RMy

(y −˜Gω)T ˜R−1(y −˜Gω)
	
.
(30)
Recall that the terms in this formulation are detailed for
the C-DGNSS model in Tables II and III.
(a) All receivers share the same K = 9 satellites in view. Matrix subscripts denote
user indices.
(b) One receiver observes fewer satellites than the rest (Kc = 4); notation for
constrained and open-sky users follows Sec. IV-A.
Fig. 3: Heatmaps of the C-RTK covariance matrix for pseudorange
measurements, ˜Σp,α
b,ρ , under the assumptions of Remark 1 (cf. (25)),
with W = I, σρ = 1 m, N = 3, and α = 1. An analogous pattern
is obtained for ˜Σp,α
b,Φ. [k, :] and [:, k] denote row and column slices.
See [30, Fig. 3] for the C-DGNSS case under α = 1. See Supplemental
Material (Sec. S1-D) for a detailed explanation of the element-wise
noise contributions in C-RTK.
The estimator in (30) can be obtained through an
iterative procedure that relinearizes the system model at
each step, equivalent to the Gauss–Newton optimization
method [57]. At the k-th iteration, one has
ˆωk+1 = ˆωk +

˜Gk⊤˜R−1 ˜Gk−1 ˜Gk⊤˜R−1(y −˜Gk ˆωk),
(31)
where the geometry matrix ˜Gk is evaluated at ˆωk, al-
though this dependency is omitted in the notation for
simplicity. Remarkably, the computational cost of the pro-
posed estimator in (31) is dominated by the inversion of
( ˜G⊤˜R−1 ˜G), which scales as O(N 3), increasing rapidly
with the number of users and motivating future work on
distributed formulations to improve scalability.
Given the Gaussian assumption in (16), the estima-
tor in (30) is optimal and equivalent to the maximum
likelihood estimator (MLE), whose estimation accuracy is
theoretically lower-bounded by the CRB. To evaluate the
CRB for a specific user r, we extract the corresponding
3 × 3 submatrix from the FIM, which is associated with
that user’s 3D position parameters. For this purpose, we
introduce the operator [30], [54]
blockr(X) = X[3(r −1) + 1 : 3r, 3(r −1) + 1 : 3r],
(32)
where [i : j, k : l] denotes the submatrix formed by rows
i to j and columns k to l, and the indices follow a one-
based convention, with r ∈{1, 2, . . . , N}.
A lower bound on the variance of the estimate of the
i-th parameter is provided by the CRB as
Var(ˆωi) ≥CRB(ωi) = [J−1(ω)]ii,
(33)

∂2 ln p(y; ω)
∂ωi∂ωj

= [ ˜GT ˜R−1 ˜G]i,j.
(34)
As a scalar 3D positioning performance metric for
receiver r we calculate the root mean square error
(RMSE) of its position estimate, expressed in meters, as
p
Tr [blockr (J−1(ω))].
2. Cooperative RTK Estimator and Bound
The model in (1) defines a mixed linear regression
problem involving both real-valued parameters ω and
integer-valued parameters z, a characteristic feature of
GNSS carrier-phase positioning [58]. Due to the integer
nature of z, the estimation problem admits no closed-
form solution. Following standard RTK practice, a three-
stage procedure is adopted (i.e., float estimation, integer
ambiguity resolution, and fixed estimation) and this ar-
chitecture is extended to the cooperative setting in [29].
In [58], the performance of this mixed real–integer es-
timation problem is characterized by a McAulay-Seidman
(MSB) constructed from a finite set of test points. That
framework provides a rigorous treatment of both float
and fixed regimes but leads to expressions that are not
easily embedded in the unified C-DGNSS/C-RTK anal-
ysis introduced in this work. We therefore focus on the
corresponding Cram´er–Rao-type bounds that describe the
float and fix regions of C-RTK, which can be interpreted
as limiting cases of the MSB when the ambiguities remain
unresolved (float) or are correctly fixed. For completeness,
we briefly summarize these bounds below and refer the
reader to [58] for the full MSB formulation.
Note that in addition to the CRB, the probability of
success of integer ambiguity resolution (i.e., the likeli-
hood that the correct integer vector is fixed) can be upper
bounded as in [29, Eq. (17)].
C-RTK Float: When the integer ambiguities are
treated as real-valued, i.e., ω ∈RKω, z ∈RKz, C-RTK
operates in the float regime. In this case, the FIM for θ
is given by (see [58, Eq. (26)] for the non-cooperative
case):

.
(35)
Here, we incorporate α as defined in Remark 1, assume
uncorrelated carrier-phase and code measurements follow-
ing (25), and adopt from (21) ˜AΦ = λ IN(K−1), ˜Aρ = 0,
and ˜Bρ = ˜BΦ. Let U, V, and W denote the top-left, off-
diagonal, and bottom-right blocks of (35), respectively.
The CRB for ω corresponds to the (1, 1) block of J(θ)−1,
which by the Schur complement is
CRB(ˆω) =

(36)
In the float regime, precision is dominated by the code
measurements because the ambiguities remain unresolved.
The RTK float bound corresponds to the information
obtained after projecting the observation matrix onto the
subspace orthogonal to the ambiguity space [33, Eq.
(2.16)].
C-RTK Fix: Further gains arise once the ambiguities
are correctly resolved and treated as integers. In this fix
region, the FIM for ω is given by [58, Eq. (25a)]
J(ω) = ˜B⊤( ˜Σp,α

where the assumptions and matrix definitions from (35)
continue to apply. Under the standard assumption that
σΦ ≪σρ, the approximation ( ˜Σp,α
b,Φ)−1 + ( ˜Σp,α
b,ρ )−1 ≈
( ˜Σp,α
b,Φ)−1 holds, leading to an estimation precision domi-

CRB(ˆω) ≈

Thus far in this work, we have introduced unified obser-
vation models for cooperative DGNSS and cooperative
RTK, along with their position estimation problems and
CRB-based performance bounds.
IV.
Theoretical Performance Analysis
This section provides a comprehensive theoretical
analysis of the asymptotic performance of the C-DGNSS
and C-RTK estimators as a function of three key pa-
rameters relevant to the cooperative positioning scenario
considered in this work, as illustrated in Fig. 1: (i) the
number of aiding users in the network No; (ii) the number
of satellites exclusively visible to them Ko; and (iii) the
variance ratio α, introduced in Remark 1.
Sec. IV-A introduces the two-cluster visibility model
considered in this work. In Sec. IV-B, we provide the
closed-form expression of the FIM in (29) parameterized
as a function of No, Ko, and α, with the detailed steps
given in Sec. S2 of the Supplemental Material. Sec. IV–C
presents the theoretical asymptotic analysis.
A.
Network Clustering
We address the inherent heterogeneity of satellite
visibility in practical GNSS deployments by classifying
the cooperative network into two clusters.
The first cluster comprises Nc constrained-visibility
users (also referred to as aided users), operating under
constrained visibility conditions, such as in urban envi-
ronments, with access to Kc satellites. The second cluster
consists of the remaining No = N −Nc open-sky users
(also referred to as aiding users), who observe a total
of K = Kc + Ko satellites, where Ko ≥0 denotes the
number of satellites exclusively visible to this group.

Figure 3 depicts how the covariance structure formu-
lated in Definitions 1 and 2 varies between a homoge-
neous and a clustered network, the latter including users
with constrained visibility.
To incorporate the clustered geometry into the unified
cooperative model in (1), we define


,
and ˜Ro = Cα
No ⊗R. Furthermore, in (40), we adopt the
assumptions outlined in Remark 1 and consider the case
Nc = 1, which facilitates the analytical manipulation of
the covariance expression while still providing a represen-
tative assessment of the position estimation performance
for an aided user. This performance is quantified by
CRB(ˆωc) = block1(J(ω)−1),
(41)
where ωc ∈R3 denotes the real-valued unknowns asso-
ciated with the aided user. Let us introduce
Jc = G⊤
c R−1
c Gc,
Jo = G⊤
o R−1
o Go,
(42)
where Jc and Jo capture the Fisher information from
jointly observed satellites and from satellites visible only
to the aiding users, respectively.
Theoretical Benchmarks: We consider two bench-
marks for comparison. The first is the non-cooperative
bound reflecting the performance of standard differential
architectures, i.e., DGNSS, RTK, defined as
CRBNon-Coop = (1 + α) J−1
c .
(43)
Here, the factor 1 + α accounts for the contribution of
error variances from both the base station and the aided
user, as reflected in the diagonal elements of (22). The
second is the ideal bound, which is defined as
CRBIdeal = J−1
c .
(44)
This corresponds to a differential architecture with noise-
less base station, i.e., α = 0, yielding to a performance
bounded by he geometry of the aided user.
B. Parameterized Fisher Information Matrix
From the unified linear model in (29), the FIM admits
the parameterization in (45) for arbitrary No and α, owing
to the block structure of ˜R. The intermediate derivation
steps leading to (45) and the coefficients βi(α), i ∈
{0, 1, . . . , 5} are provided in Sec. S2 of the Supplemental
Material. The compact and full definitions of βi(α) are
listed in Table VI; β3(α) is only used in the supplement.
TABLE IV: βi(α) coefficient definitions as introduced in Sec. IV–B.
Note that β1 = β2 + 1 and β4 = β5 + 1. Derivations leading to these
expressions can be found in Sec. S2 of the Supplemental Material.

Left/right-multiplication by
˜G preserves the block
structure of ˜R, mapping each covariance block into its
corresponding block of J(ω). The diagonal blocks scale
with Jc and Jo, reflecting the contributions of common
and exclusive satellites, whereas the off-diagonal blocks
depend solely on Jc. This results in the compact expres-
sion in (45), whose sub-blocks Mij for i, j ∈{1, 2} will
be used in the asymptotic analysis of Sections IV–C. For
the compact form of block M22, we use that β1 = β2 +1
and β4 = β5 + 1, as explained in the supplement.
C.
Study of Asymptotic Regimes
This section focuses on the term in (41) capturing the
estimation performance of the aided user, which can be
calculated with the Schur complement of matrix (45) as
CRB(ˆωc) =
 M11 −M12M−1
22 M21
−1 .
(46)
We next examine this bound under key limiting regimes.
Note that for No = 0, the bound reduces to the non-
cooperative case and needs no further analysis.
It can be shown that the CRB for code-based DGNSS
and RTK float are equivalent in the absence of ephemeris
or satellite clock errors. Hence, the asymptotic analysis
based on the C-DGNSS block structure in (40) also
characterizes the asymptotic regimes of C-RTK float.
Moreover, since the C-RTK fixed bound in (38) has the
same analytical form, differing only by the measurement
precision, these conclusions also extend to C-RTK fixed.

Ideal Aiding-Cluster Satellite Visibility

the aiding users, i.e., an aiding cluster whose exclusive
satellites provide arbitrarily large Fisher information.

The detailed block-matrix and Kronecker-product manipulations are deferred to Sec. S2 of the Supplemental Material.
where the inequality holds for all No ∈N0 and α >
0. This result shows that, under ideal aiding visibility,
cooperation always yields an improvement over the non-
cooperative bound in (43).
The term β1(α)−1 decreases monotonically with No,
indicating that the cooperative bound becomes increas-
ingly tighter as more aiding users are added. This mono-
tonic decrease is confirmed by
∂β1(α)−1
∂No
= −
α2
(αNo+1)2
being strictly negative for all α > 0. For a fixed No and
α1 > α2, we have
 ∂β1(α1)−1
∂No
 >
 ∂β1(α2)−1
∂No
, meaning
that β1(α)−1 decreases faster with No when α is larger. In
other words, the rate of improvement due to cooperation
is more noticeable for noisier reference stations.
2. Homogeneous Inter-Cluster Satellite Visibility
We examine the homogeneous case Jo = 0, where all
users have identical visibility and no aiding user provides
additional information. This serves as a baseline to test
whether cooperation can help when visibility offers no
diversity. The CRB under homogeneous satellite visibility
is given by:

In (52a) we use the auxiliary matrix Ω2 = (1⊤
No ⊗
IKc)(1No ⊗Jc) = (1⊤
No1No) ⊗Jc = NoJc.
The result in (52c) shows that, for finite No, co-
operation provides no gain when aiding users offer no
additional visibility. In this scenario, adding users with
identical information, effectively corresponding to Nc >
1, leaves the performance unchanged.
3. Disjoint Inter-Cluster Satellite Visibility
We consider the case in which the constrained user
shares no satellites with the aiding users, whose observa-
tion matrix in (39) reduces to G = Go, corresponding to
observations of Ko satellites only. Under this condition,
the covariance in (40) becomes block diagonal, with
all cross-covariance terms vanishing, and its structure
comprising an upper-left block (1 + α)Rc and a lower-
right block Cα
No ⊗Ro. The FIM for this case is:
J(ω)|G=Go =




.
Comparing this result with the non-disjoint case in (45),
the aiding-user block preserves its cooperative structure,
whereas the constrained-user block reduces to (1 + α)Jc
rather than β1(α)Jc. Consequently, the Schur complement
yields the non-cooperative bound in (43), indicating that
disjoint satellite visibility provides no benefit to the con-
strained user.
4. Large-Scale Cooperative Network
To characterize the asymptotic behavior of coopera-
tion, we consider the regime where the number of aiding
users grows without bound. In this limit, β1(α) −−−−→
No→∞1
and β2(α) −−−−→
No→∞0, so the FIM in (45) converges to
J(ω) −−−−→
No→∞

The cross-information terms vanish, and the Schur com-
plement reduces to

(54)
Hence, in large-scale networks, cooperation asymptoti-
cally removes the impact of the base-station noise and
drives the constrained-user bound to the ideal limit deter-
mined solely by Jc.
V.
Simulation Experiments
This section evaluates the proposed methodologies
through simulation experiments. We first outline the ex-
perimental setup, followed by an analysis of the impact of
No, Ko, and α on the 3D position RMSE and ambiguity
fix success rate of the proposed cooperative differential
GNSS frameworks. For a consolidated overview of the
observed trends, see Table V.
An elevation mask of 20◦is applied, with the base
station tracking a total of K = 19 satellites. The con-
strained visibility cluster comprises Nc = 2 aided users,
each observing Kc = 4 satellites with geometric dilution
of precision (GDOP) of 2.5. The weighting matrix is
set to Wr = I, reflecting the assumption of identical
noise variance across all satellites. To obtain statistically
meaningful results, M
= 104 Monte Carlo runs are
conducted for each parameter variation and experiment.
The performance of the cooperative differential GNSS
estimator is reported for the first user in the constrained-
visibility cluster and is compared against two reference
limits: the model CRB and the asymptotic benchmark
β1(α)−1 corresponding to the ideal-visibility regime dis-
cussed in Sec. IV-C.1.
Figure 4 highlights the complementary roles of the
inter-user correlation factor α and the number of aiding
users No in cooperative positioning. For increasing values
of α, the RMSE grows as expected, since a larger α
implies a higher noise contribution from the base station,
which directly inflates the effective measurement covari-
ance of all single-differenced observations. Nevertheless,
for any fixed α, cooperation consistently improves po-
sitioning performance. The gain increases with both the
number of aiding users No and the number of additional
satellites they observe Ko, since both factors enhance the
network visibility. For fixed No and α, as Ko grows, the
cooperative RMSE approaches the asymptotic benchmark
β−1
1 , reflecting the ideal-visibility regime. This trend is
observed across all values of α, confirming that sufficient
cooperative visibility can compensate for increased base-
station noise.
We provide additional experiments considering the
C-RTK framework to assess the impact of cooperation
on carrier-phase positioning and integer ambiguity res-
olution. In this experiment, the base station and aiding
receivers track a total of K = Ko = 8 satellites, while
the aided user (Nc = 1) observes Kc = 4 satellites,
yielding a standalone GDOP of 2.97. The base–rover
variance ratio is set to α = 1 for both code and carrier-
phase observations, and σΦ = σρ/100. The empirical
ambiguity–resolution success rate is defined as

Figure 5 (left) depicts the positioning RMSE as a
function of the code variance of the receivers (both aided
and aiding) for different numbers of cooperating users.
Two regimes are clearly observed, namely the float and fix
regimes, and in both cases cooperation yields a consistent
improvement over the non-cooperative baseline. It can be
observed that increasing the number of cooperating users
shifts the transition to the fixed-ambiguity regime toward
higher noise levels, indicating that cooperation enables
faster and more reliable ambiguity resolution. This effect
is further quantified in Fig. 5 (right), which shows a
marked increase in the empirical ambiguity resolution
success rate as the number of cooperating users grows.
VI. Conclusion
We introduce a unified estimation framework for
cooperative differential GNSS that integrates code- and
carrier-phase techniques while accommodating reference
stations of arbitrary noise quality. Using analytical manip-
ulations of the Fisher Information Matrix, we characterize
the asymptotic performance of C-DGNSS and C-RTK
as a function of receiver count, satellite visibility, and
measurement variance. Cooperation improves the posi-
tioning accuracy of users with limited satellite visibility,
and the influence of base-station noise diminishes as
the network size increases when cooperative users bring
enhanced visibility. In large networks, the achievable
accuracy converges to the limit imposed by the user’s
own satellite geometry. For carrier-phase positioning, the
C-RTK formulation further enhances ambiguity resolution
relative to independent RTK solutions. Simulation results
validate the theoretical insights presented in this paper.
Our findings show that even low-cost reference stations
can deliver high-quality positioning when leveraging mul-
tiple users, offering a pathway toward more accessible
differential GNSS services.

Note that sections, equations, and tables in this supplement are prefixed with “S”. References without this prefix
correspond to the main paper. Notation follows as in the main paper.
Recall that, in this work, we assume a network composed of one surveyed, and potentially low-cost, reference
station (indexed by b) and N user receivers (indexed by r ∈{1, . . . , N}), as illustrated in Fig. 1. The reference station
observes a set of K satellites (indexed by s ∈{p, 1, . . . , K−1}), where p denotes the pivot satellite used for double
differencing, and each user receiver is assumed to observe all or a subset of these satellites depending on visibility
conditions.
Throughout these derivations, we make use of the following Kronecker-product identities, which enable convenient
manipulation of matrices whose dimensions grow with the cooperative nature of the algorithm:
• Transpose identity: (A ⊗B)⊤= A⊤⊗B⊤.
• Inverse identity (for invertible A and B): (A ⊗B)−1 = A−1 ⊗B−1.
• Mixed-product property: (A⊗B)(C ⊗D) = (AC)⊗(BD), whenever the products AC and BD are well defined.
SI. Expanded Form of the Observation and Covariance Matrices
A. Single-User Model
Recall the single-user observation model defined in (10):
∆ρr = Hr δxr + c dt + Tr + Ir + εr ∈RK,
∆Φr = Hr δxr + c dt + Tr −Ir + λNr + ϵr ∈RK.
(S1)
We expand the observation matrix hereafter for the sake of subsequent derivations (recall that we assume Hr = H, ∀r):

Here, the diagonal blocks capture intra-user terms, with diagonal entries reflecting the combined base–user variance
for each satellite and zero off-diagonals. The off-diagonal blocks contain only base-station noise: their diagonals
include the base variance for each satellite, and their off-diagonals are zero, indicating no inter-user cross-correlation
beyond the shared base.

The diagonal blocks capture the intra-user correlation terms: their diagonal entries contain a fourfold variance
contribution (from both the base and the user at the pivot satellite, and from both the base and the user at the
corresponding satellite), and the off-diagonal elements contain a twofold contribution arising solely from the pivot-
satellite terms (from base and user).

The off-diagonal blocks encode the inter-user correlation terms and contain only contributions from the base-station
noise. Within each block, the diagonal entries exhibit a twofold contribution from the base station (one term associated
with the common satellite and one with the pivot), whereas the off-diagonal entries include only the pivot-satellite
contribution.
SII. Full Derivation of the Parameterized Fisher Information Matrix
In this section, we present the complete derivations leading to ˜R−1 in (S30) and to the Fisher information matrix
(FIM) J(˜ω) in (45), as referenced in Sec. IV–B. The expressions of the coefficients βi(α), i ∈{0, 1, . . . , 5} listed
in Table VI are also derived. Importantly, the network clustering model presented in Sec. IV-A must be considered
hereafter.
A. Covariance Matrix Inverse
We first derive the expression of ˜R−1 for arbitrary No and α via the Schur complement of (40), where we use
X = (1 + α)Rc, Y = Pα
No = 1¯

, and Z = ˜Cα
No ⊗R, and denote the four blocks of ˜R−1 by
[ ˜R−1]ij for i, j ∈{1, 2}.
• Step 1 (top-diagonal block): To obtain [ ˜R−1]11 = (X −YZ−1Y⊤)−1, let us start by calculating Z−1 as:
Z−1 = ( ˜Cα
No ⊗R)−1 = [INo + α1No]−1 ⊗R−1 =

last equality, we have used the Sherman–Morrison formula, which allows the inversion of a rank-one modification of
the identity matrix as

Here, βi,j(α) = βj(α) −βi(α). Note that β3,4(α) = β1(α) and β3,5(α) = β2(α). Additionally, in the last equality, we

B. Fisher Information Matrix (FIM)
The FIM follows directly from the unified linear model in (29). Owing to the block structure of ˜R−1 in (S30),
multiplication by ˜G preserves this structure and maps each block of ˜R−1 into the corresponding block of J(ω). This
yields the compact expression in (45), which is used in Sec. IV–C to analyze the asymptotic performance of the
C-DGNSS/C-RTK estimators.

where we can see two contributions: one from multiplying G⊤with the diagonal terms of [R−1]22, and another from
multiplying G⊤with its off-diagonal terms. We calculate each of these contributions and add them up, as follows:

To integrate these calculations into the full block, we use
M22 = INo ⊗(β1(α)Jc + β4(α)Jo) + (1No −INo) ⊗(β2(α)Jc + β5(α)Jo)
(S40)
=
(INo + β2(α) 1No)⊗Jc + (INo + β5(α) 1No)⊗Jo = M22
