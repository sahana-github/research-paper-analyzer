Synchronization transition in oscillatory networks manifests itself as the appearance of a periodic
global mode. While perfect in the thermodynamic limit, this mode fluctuates for finite ensembles.
We characterize the coherence of this mode in terms of the phase diffusion constant. In several
examples, we always observed normal diffusion, but the dependence of the diffusion constant on the
system size D ∼N −µ depends on the nature of coupled units: for coupled chaotic systems µ = 1,
while for coupled periodic oscillators we observe, depending on the particular model, µ = 2 and
µ = 2.5. These large values of the power index are attributed to the size-dependence of collective
chaos in the finite ensemble, which disappears in the thermodynamic limit. We also show that in
the standard Kuramoto model for a symmetric set of frequencies, there is an additional transition
to a symmetric chaotic state with vanishing diffusion of the global phase.
Introduction. Clocks are not perfect: due to ambient
noise, the coherence time is finite. The phase of the pe-
riodic self-sustained oscillators diffuses due to noise, and
the diffusion constant, which has the dimension of inverse
time, determines the coherence time and the width of the
spectral peak [1, 2]. This concept can also be applied
to collective oscillating modes appearing due to synchro-
nization of individual units in large ensembles [3, 4]. Such
transitions are usually theoretically treated in the ther-
modynamic limit of an infinite number of units [5, 6]. In
this limit, the transition to synchrony appears as a tran-
sition from a steady to oscillating mean field (typically
via a Hopf bifurcation [5, 7, 8]). A periodic regime in the
thermodynamic limit has infinite coherence time (except
for cases where the collective mode in the thermodynamic
limit is chaotic [9–12]; we do not consider such regimes
in this Letter).
In experimental realizations of the synchronization
transition, the number of interacting units N is neces-
sarily finite, and in many cases rather small: 64 chemical
oscillators in [13, 14]; 72 electronic oscillators in [15]; 108
and 690 Josephson junctions in [16]; 40 photochemical
oscillators in [17]; 1600 chemical Belousov-Zhabotinsky
oscillators in [18]; several hundreds of lasers in [19]; 30
metronoms in [20]. In some cases, the number of inter-
acting units is itself a bifurcation parameter.
For ex-
ample, the collective mode of the Millennium Bridge in
London appeared when the number of walkers exceeded
N = 164 [21].
For a finite number of coupled elements, the appear-
ing global mode is subject to finite-size fluctuations (un-
less the full locking at a large coupling strength occurs).
These fluctuations have been explored numerically and
theoretically in [22–35]. However, in most cases, the fo-
cus was not on the coherence properties of the phase of
the collective mode, but on the finite-size effects in the
amplitude dynamics. Only in Refs. [24, 32] has the phase
diffusion constant been demonstrated to scale ∼N −1
with the population size, for coupled noisy oscillators.
Another situation in which the diffusion of the phase of
the collective mode was studied is the Hamiltonian mean-
field model [36, 37]. There, due to momentum conserva-
tion, the dominant mode of motion of the collective phase
is a ballistic one, with a transition to normal diffusion at
a time that diverges with the system size.
The goal of this Letter is to explore properties of the
diffusion of the collective mode in ensembles of determin-
istic units. We demonstrate that coupled chaotic oscilla-
tors produce a regular mode with phase diffusion scaling
∼N −1, like for coupled noisy units [24, 32]. On the con-
trary, for ensembles of periodic oscillators, we observe
much stronger decay of the diffusion with the system
size. We also describe a remarkable transition, due to
symmetry, in the standard Kuramoto system to a fully
phase-coherent (but still chaotic) regime with quenched
diffusion.
Before proceeding to the consideration of particular
systems, let us discuss the general conditions for the ex-
istence of the global phase. Suppose that in the thermo-
dynamic limit, there is a Hopf-type transition from static
to oscillating mean field at critical coupling εc. One usu-
ally characterizes the transition with the amplitude of
global oscillations R, which is zero for ε < εc and is pos-
itive for ε > εc. Fluctuations due to finite-size effects
smear the transition, so that the amplitude R fluctuates
and is non-zero at all couplings, and the average of R
grows rapidly around εc. Still, as long as the amplitude
of collective oscillations can vanish (or be very small) at
arXiv:2601.05963v1  [nlin.CD]  9 Jan 2026

some instants of time, the phase of these oscillations is
ill-defined. Only when the amplitude R is distinct from
zero is the phase well-defined. The criterion for the on-
set of the global oscillating mode based on finding the
coupling strength εR beyond which Rmin > γ for some
small threshold γ, has been suggested and used in exper-
iments [15, 38] and numerically explored in [39]. Clearly,
the threshold for existence of the global collective mode
εR depends on the system size and εR becomes closer to
εc from above as N →∞; this threshold defines the do-
main with a well-defined phase where the phase diffusion
properties can be explored.

can be considered as the complex amplitude of the col-
lective mode, where R is the real amplitude and Θ is the
phase of the collective global mode. We expect that for
ε > εR, where the amplitude R is separated from zero,
the phase Θ is well-defined, and one can calculate its aver-
aged rotation velocity Ω= limT →∞T −1(Θ(T)−Θ(0)), as
well as the diffusion constant D = limT →∞T −1⟨(Θ(T)−
Θ(0) −ΩT)2⟩. The relevant parameter in problem (1)
is the distribution of frequencies g(ω). In simple cases
like Gaussian and Cauchy distributions (because of rota-
tional invariance, one can set the center of the distribu-
tion at ω = 0), transition to synchrony in the thermody-
namic limit occurs via a Hopf bifurcation to a state with
R = const and Ω= const.
In the simulation of a finite ensemble, one has to fix
a way of choosing frequencies ωk.
We first consider a
regular sampling [22, 26, 30, 33, 35] according to relation
R ωk
−∞g(ξ)dξ = (k −1/2)/N. This yields just one system
for each N. Below we adopt for g(ω) a Gaussian dis-
tribution with unit variance. Fig. 1 shows an example
of the phase diffusion and the dependence of the diffu-
sion constant D on the ensemble size N, for parameters
α = π/4, ε = 2.5. The results show that with good accu-
racy, the law D ∼N −2 holds. This means that the diffu-
sion constant decreases much more strongly with the sys-
tem size than the variance of amplitude variations, which
decreases in the supercritical regime as ∼N −1 [22, 31].
We attribute this strong drop of the diffusion constant to
weak chaos, to be discussed below.
Above, we considered regular sampling, so that, for
each N, there is a unique system. If, in contrast, one uses
random sampling, then for each N there is an ensemble

of different systems with different values of the diffusion
constant. To compare these constants at different N, we
calculated the distribution functions of D at different N,
using ≈1000 random samples for each N. Because the
spread of diffusion constant at given N is large, we com-
pare in Fig. 2 the distributions of log D. To check for the
scaling ∼N −2, we depict the cumulative distributions
of the rescaled diffusion constant D(N/100)2 (so that for
the smallest size N = 100 there is no rescaling). One can
see that the plots intersect nearly at the same point at
the level 1/2, thus confirming the scaling D ∼N −2.
Other examples of collective modes in ensembles of
chaotic and regular units.
The KS is a representative
example of a synchronization transition, but one cannot
expect its quantitative properties to be universally valid.
Here we present evaluations of the coherence of the global
mode for three other models (their equations are given
in the Appendix). The first model that exhibits quali-
tatively similar synchronization transition is the Morris-
Lecar (ML) neuron model (8). A single neuron is in spik-
ing oscillatory states, and upon a strong enough coupling,

a global periodic field appears in an ensemble. Some neu-
rons with natural frequencies close to that of the mean
field are locked, others are not entrained; this regime is
similar to the synchronous state in the KS model (1).
Calculations of the phase diffusion constant of the mean
field reveal that it decays more strongly with the ensem-
ble size: D ∼N −2.48, see Fig. 3(b).
A regime where some oscillators are locked by the mean
field while others are not is not the only type of syn-
chrony in large ensembles.
There exists so-called par-
tial synchronization [41–44] where no one unit is locked,
and nevertheless there is a collective oscillating mode;
see [15, 38] for an experimental observation in a set of
electronic generators. As an example of such a type of
synchrony, we use a globally nonlinear coupled system of
SL oscillators (7). For this model, the scaling of the dif-
fusion constant with the system size is nearly the same
as for the KS model above: D ∼N −2, see Fig. 3(a)
(best fits for different values of the distribution width of
natural frequencies are in the range (1.92, 2.03).)
Finally, we explored coherence properties of the col-
lective mode for coupled chaotic oscillators.
We took
an ensemble of Roessler oscillators (6). Each oscillator
possesses a funnel attractor with ill-defined phase; how-
ever, the global mode is nearly periodic with well-defined
phase, as has been shown in [45, 46]. Diffusion constant
in this case scales like D ∼N −1, as shown in Fig. 3(c).
We now explore why, in different cases, the diffusion
constant of the global mode shows different dependence
on the system size. Let us introduce the instantaneous
frequency of the global mode (“global frequency”) de-
fined as Ω(t) = ˙Θ(t).
Because Θ is defined via mean
fields, the process Ω(t) is also some kind of a mean
field.
For example, for the KS model (1),(2), one has
Ω= (NR)−1 P
k cos(φk−Θ)(ωk+εR P(Θ−φk−α)). We
have found that in all considered examples the variance
of the global frequency scales as var(Ω) ∼N −1. How-
ever, it is not the variance of the stationary process Ω(t)
that determines the diffusion constant, but, according to
the Green-Kubo formula, the integral of the autocorre-
lation function (or, in spectral representation, the level
of the continuous component of the spectrum at zero fre-
quency). For the decay of the autocorrelation function,
one needs the deterministic ensemble to be chaotic. We
have characterized this chaoticity by means of the largest
Lyapunov exponent λ. For coupled chaotic Roessler sys-
tems, this exponent practically does not depend on the
system size N, which explains why the diffusion constant
in this case scales like D ∼N −1, following the scaling of
var(Ω). In all other cases, the Lyapunov exponent tends
to zero in the thermodynamic limit, as has been observed
also for the Kuramoto model [47, 48]. For the KS model
(1) and for nonlinearly coupled SL oscillators (7) we have
found λ ∼N −1, while for the ML systems (8) we have
found λ ∼N −0.56. This qualitatively explains why the
diffusion constant decays strongly in these situations: in
addition to a “standard” N −1 law for the variance of the
global frequency, the chaotic component of its variations
also vanishes in the thermodynamic limit. We stress here
that the largest Lyapunov exponent is only indirectly re-
lated to the decay of correlations of the global frequency;
in particular, the next example shows that in a chaotic
ensemble, the diffusion constant can vanish identically.
Symmetry transition and quenched diffusion in the Ku-
ramoto model. Above we started with the KS model, and
not with the “standard” Kuramoto model (i.e., Eq. (1)
with α = 0). The reason is that the latter demonstrates
rather nontrivial properties of coherence. Next, we show
that the Kuramoto model with a regular sampling of fre-
quencies possesses a symmetric state in which phase dif-
fusion is quenched, and this state is stable over a certain
range of parameters. This symmetric state has been men-
tioned by Daido [22], without stability considerations, as
a possible regime for corresponding symmetric initial con-
ditions. Stability properties have been first discussed in
[47, 49] and explored at small couplings in [50].
For definiteness, we assume the number of units N =
4
2M to be even; for an odd N, a simple reformulation
of the theory below is needed. We write the Kuramoto
system as
˙φk = ωk + ε(S cos φk −C sin φk),
C = 1
N

Furthermore, we assume that the frequencies are pairwise
symmetric ωk = −ω−k. We introduce new variables
um = φm −φ−m
2
, vm = φm + φ−m
2
, m = 1, . . . , M .
In this variables the Kuramoto model (3) reads
˙um = ωm −ε sin um(C cos vm + S sin vm) ,
˙vm = ε cos um(S cos vm −C sin vm) ,
C = M −1

One can easily check that v1 = . . . = vM = V = const
is the invariant manifold of this system of equations, for
arbitrary V . The arbitrariness of V reflects the invari-
ance of the Kuramoto model with respect to a shift of
all the phases. The complex mean field is represented
through the introduced quantities as Z(t) = R(t)eiΘ(t) =
C(t) + iS(t) and the instantaneous global frequency is
Ω(t) = ˙Θ = ( ˙SC −˙CS)/(S2 + C2). On the other hand,
on the symmetric manifold
C = Q(t) cos V, S = Q(t) sin V, Q(t) = M −1
M
X
j=1
cos uj .
Substituting this in the instantaneous frequency of the
global mode, we obtain that on the symmetric manifold
˙Ω= 0. This means that the variations of the global fre-
quency vanish, and the diffusion is quenched.
On the
symmetric manifold, only the variables um vary, and in
general their dynamics is chaotic. Existence of a sym-
metric manifold corresponds to the well-known effect of
complete synchronization of chaotic systems [3, 51, 52].
According to the general theory of complete synchro-
nization [3, 53], stability of the chaotic symmetric state is
determined by the largest transversal Lyapunov exponent
on the symmetric manifold. To calculate it, we assume a
weak violation of symmetry vm = V + wm, which, after
linearization in wm, leads to a system (where um(t) is a
chaotic trajectory on the symmetric manifold)

One can see from Eq. (5) that there is always a uniform
solution w1 = . . . = vM with zero Lyapunov exponent;
this solution corresponds to a shift of the constant V and
is not transversal. To calculate the transversal Lyapunov
exponent, we thus set P
j wj = 0.

=
limt→∞t−1 ln ||w(t)||/||w(0)|| for the Kuramoto model
with regular sampled Gaussian distribution of frequen-
cies, for a range of system sizes. The results are presented
in Fig. 4. The values of the transversal LEs vary signif-
icantly with the system size N, but the transition point
ελ at which this exponent becomes negative only weakly
depends on N, as is clear from panel (b), where the value
of the coupling constant ελ at which the transversal Lya-
punov exponent changes sign, is presented. In this panel,
we also show the value of the coupling εR, starting from
which the minimal value of the order parameter R over
a long run becomes larger than 0.1, which we use as
an indicator for the existence of a global mode with a
well-defined phase. One can see that the curves cross at
Ns ≈60. For smaller system sizes, the symmetric state
becomes stable already in the state where the phase is
ill-defined; thus, here, no regime with phase diffusion
is observed. For N > Ns, there is a range of coupling
constants εR < ε < ελ where the phase is well-defined
and diffuses. With an increase of coupling strength, for
ε > ελ, a symmetric state occurs with vanishing diffu-
sion.
The symmetric state with vanishing global phase dy-
namics is destroyed if the symmetry of system (3) is bro-
ken. We illustrate this in Fig. 5 with two types of symme-
try breaking. In the first example (panel (a)), we take the

same symmetric natural frequencies as above, but insert
a small phase shift α to the coupling terms, making the
KS system out of the Kuramoto system. In the second
example (panel (b)), we illustrate the situation where the
coupling is symmetric, but the set of natural frequencies
is slightly skewed. Namely, we sample these frequencies
regularly from the beta distribution B(3+δ, 3−δ) with a
small skewness parameter δ. In both cases, the variance
of the global frequency grows as the second power of the
symmetry-breaking parameter.
Conclusion. In this Letter, we explored finite-size in-
duced coherence properties of populations of coupled os-
cillators. The measure of coherence is the diffusion con-
stant of the global mode’s phase.
The results provide
a new, richer scenario, complementing previous studies
of the amplitude fluctuations and of phase diffusion in
an ensemble of noisy units.
First, the global phase is
ill-defined prior to and in the vicinity of the synchroniza-
tion transition; we used the condition that the global am-
plitude is separated from zero to define a region where
calculation of the phase diffusion makes sense. Second,
in this domain we always observed normal diffusion at
which the variance of the phase differences grows pro-
portional to the time lag. Third, we found that if the
interacting units are chaotic, then the diffusion scales
D ∼N −1 with the same exponent as for coupled noisy
units. The reason is that the effective disorder in the dy-
namics does not disappear in the thermodynamic limit,
and the scaling is consistent with central-limit-theorem-
like arguments. Fourth, for coupled periodic oscillators,
we have found much stronger decay of the diffusion con-
stant with the system size, with powers ≈2 for the KS
model and coupled SL oscillators, and ≈2.5 for coupled
ML neurons. At the moment, it is not clear if there are
different universality classes; one needs to consider more
examples.
The strong decay of the diffusion constant
can be attributed to weak system-size-dependent chaos in
these models, characterized by the largest Lyapunov ex-
ponent that vanishes in the thermodynamic limit, which
yields additional smallness to the usual ∼N −1 decays of
mean field fluctuations. In addition to the general fea-
tures above, we have shown that the standard Kuramoto
model with a symmetric set of natural frequencies ex-
hibits, at sufficiently strong couplings, a symmetric state
in which the global phase remains constant in time. We
expect this property to hold in other symmetric systems,
such as coupled SL oscillators.

because ˙Y = X + aY . These observables are normalized
as Y →
Y −⟨Y ⟩
ST D(Y ) and the same for X + aY , to obtain a
maximally circular embedding. Then the phase of the
mean field is calculated as arctan
Y
X+aY . The diffusion
constant vs N is presented in Fig. 3(c).
Coupled Stuart-Landau (SL) oscillators. This model
has been studied in Ref. [54]. The equations read

Parameters are ε1 = ε2 = 3,

Note that
the nonlinear mean field means many-body coupling
(quadruplets), because A|A|2 = N −3 P

In
Fig. 3(a), we show diffusion constants vs N for a uniform
distribution of natural frequencies in an interval (−q, q),
for several values of q.
Coupled Morris-Lecar neurons.
The ML model is a
two-dimensional system describing spiking neurons. It is
formulated in terms of variables (V, n), where V is voltage
and 0 ≤n ≤1 is the portion of open potassium chan-
nels (the number of sodium channels m is taken from
6
its equilibrium value m∞at a given voltage.) We adopt,
following [55], the following model of N synaptically cou-
pled ML systems (k = 1, . . . , N; ⟨V ⟩= N −1 P
k Vk):

Inhomogeneity in the population is introduced by uni-
formly distributed external currents 100 ≤Iext,k ≤130.
Other parameters are C = 20; VK = −84; VL = −60;
VCa = 120; gK = 8; gL = 2; gCa = 4.4; Vc = 2; Vd = 30;
ϕ = 0.04. A synchronized state where approximately half
of the oscillators are locked by the mean field is achieved
at ε = 0.28, for this coupling, the diffusion constants are
shown in Fig 3(b).
